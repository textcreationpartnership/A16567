            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Kings moſt excellent Maieſtie, CHARLES, by the grace of <hi>God, King of Great-Brittaine,</hi> Fraunce, and Ireland, Defender of the Chriſtian faith &amp;c.</head>
            <p>MOST dread and renowned Soueraigne, may it pleaſe your excellent Maieſtie: ſuch is the power of Trueth, and ſpecially in Religion, that they which haue once taſted it, cleaue vnto it, more then vnto all the hopes of this life beſides: <hi>The Law of thy mouth</hi> (ſaith Dauid) <hi>is better vnto mee, then thowſands of gold &amp; ſiluer,</hi> Pſal. 119.72. Yea, ſuch is the excellency of Gods bleſſed Trueth, as his meekeſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, will ſtirr in the defence of it, &amp; the mildeſt fight, before it ſhall be indamaged by their forbearance.</p>
            <p>I durſt not petition your Highneſſe, nor aduenture theſe lines vnto your Maieſties conſideration, vntill I had by diligent ſtudie firſt, ſo ſetled my conſcience in the certaine trueth of them, as my minde gaue me, that I am tied in conſcience, rather to departe with my life, then with this Trueth; ſo captiuated is my conſcience, &amp; inthraled to the Law of my God. Here therefore I tender this Trueth, with my life, vnto your Maieſtie; that, vnto your Godly conſideration; this, vnto your clemency &amp; mercy; and both, to the pleaſure of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>I remember, when the Booke of the <hi>Law</hi> had bene loſt, and was found againe by <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the Prieſt, in the Raigne of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> 2. King. 22. that Hilkiah ſent it by <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan</hi> the <hi>Chaunteller</hi> vnto the King: which giueth me to vnderſtand, that in matters of Gods worſhip, in caſe failings and corruptions be found out, the Supreme
<pb facs="tcp:21140:3"/>power, the <hi>King,</hi> is to haue knowledge of it. More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, when the Lords Sabbath was thought to be prophaned, by the Diſciples of Chriſt, by plucking eares of corne, Mat. 12. to whom did the Phariſes complaine, but vnto Chriſt, the Lord and Maſter of the Diſciples? And when in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time the Sabbath was propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by treading the Winepreſſe, &amp; bearing of burdens, Nehem. 13. to whom did Nehemiah turne himſelfe, but vnto the <hi>Rulers</hi> &amp; <hi>Nobles</hi> of Iudah, for redreſſe?</p>
            <p>I addreſſe my ſelfe therefore vnto your Maieſtie, humblie beſeeching you, to take it into conſideration: 1. That that moſt ancient, &amp; ſacred ordinance of Gods Sabbath, preſcribed in the Morall Law; (and religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed, by the moſt anciët &amp; primitiue Churches, neere 400 yeeres after the Aſcention of Chriſt, euen ſo longe as they retained their brighteſt purity; and which ought religiouſly to be ſanctified, to the worlds end) it is now prophaned, &amp; trampled vnder foote. 2. That the Decalogue &amp; Law of God, is not taught &amp; maintained in our Church, in its fulneſſe, integrity, and perfection; but onely partially, &amp; by peeces. 3. That God hath not his whole &amp; intire worſhip &amp; ſeruice, preſcribed in the firſt Table of the Decalogue; but is denied one quarter, or fowrth part thereof weekly. 4. That by the common doctrine in our Church, the 4th Commandement is wholly fruſtrate, &amp; altogether nullified, both roote and branch. 5. That by moſt men in our Church, there is groſſe ſuperſtition committed, Gods worſhip is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and by many plain idolatry wrought, by keeping the Lords day for a Sabbath, by the 4th Com.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other things, I haue (as I beleeue) made theſe fiue things, manifeſtly appeare in this Booke; and now I humbly preſent them vnto your Highneſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; truſting, the cauſe will ſpeake for it ſelfe; and
<pb facs="tcp:21140:3"/>its bare mention, will call for a Reformation.</p>
            <p>It was the laudable and Godly care of your deere Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to cauſe in his time, a new Tranſlation of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bible, for the correction of but here and there a word; how much more (I truſt) will his ſuruiuing Sonne &amp; Heire, be mindfull of ſuch weighty matters as theſe are? <hi>Almighty God,</hi> hath honoured this eternall Law of the 10 Commandements, with ſuch honour, as he vouchſafed not, to any one portion of Scripture beſids, in all the Sacred Bible; for hee deliuered it, in moſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſticall and terrible manner; in flaming fyer, the earth trembling, Moſes &amp; the people quaking; hee ſpake it &amp; proclaimed it, with his owne voyce, and wrote it with his owne finger in Tables of ſtone. The Eternall <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> whilſt on earth bewraied ſuch care of this Law, as that hee ratified it, and euery iote &amp; title of it, to the worlds end, ſaying, <hi>Verily, I ſay vnto you, that vntill heauen &amp; earth paſse, one iote, or one title, ſhall in no wiſe paſſe from the Law, till all things be fulfilled,</hi> Mat. 5.18. The <hi>Church of God,</hi> in this Chriſtian Kingdome, honoureth at this day, this Law of God; for ſhee hath inrouled it, in hir Booke of Common Prayers; and ordered, that it be deuoutly reade, at the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> &amp; at other times of holy Aſſemblies. I truſt therefore, your Maieſtie will afford this ſacred &amp; honourable por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Word, your beſt protection.</p>
            <p>The Law, it is the inheritance of the <hi>Church,</hi> as wee reade Deut. 33.4. and who ſhould defend the Churches right, if not your Maieſtie? King <hi>Dauid</hi> choſe this Law, for his inheritance, as we reade Pſal. 119.111. and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, ſo hath your ſacred Maieſtie; defend it therefore: Why ſhould the corrupt expoſitions thereof, which the ignorance of former ages haue hatched, be ſtill retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Why ſhould one part of this ſacred Scripture, be
<pb facs="tcp:21140:4"/>retained, &amp; an other part of the ſame, reiected? Why ſhould not God haue his whole and intire worſhip, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in this Law, as well as ſome partes of it? you will not indure it, that your Coyne be clypped or impaired, but count him for a traitour that doth it; how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould you thinke well of him, that will clippe &amp; impaire, this current &amp; golden Law of God? you cannot indure it, that any part, of your Royall inheritance of Crowne Lands, ſhould be detained from you; And how ſhould you indure it, that any part of your Spirituall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the Law of God, ſhould be withholden from you any longer? Why ſhould we ſerue God by halues any longer? The Lords Sabbathes, which are a portion of Gods Law; and a part of your Maieſties, &amp; the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es inheritance, now contemned as Iewiſh, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and now prophaned &amp; trampled vnder foote, I humblie beſeech your Highneſſe, to take a care of.</p>
            <p>As the 5th Commandement, is directed vnto infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; ſo is the obſeruation of the Sabbath, in the 4th Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, directed vnto Superiours, as <hi>M. Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> in his Treatiſe on the Sabbath, hath well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; the care therefore of Gods Sabbathes, pertaineth vnto Kings; and the 4th Comm. doth in a moſt eminent ſorte, oblige Kings: Hence no doubt it was, that <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> that Godly Gouerner, tooke the reformation of the prophaned Sabbath, into his care &amp; charge: Whoſe ſteppes, may it pleaſe you to treade, hauing finiſhed the great worke, you may to your eternall comfort, with him, petition Almighty God, to be mindfull of this your care &amp; zeale for him, ſaying, <hi>Remember mee, O my God, concerning this &amp;c.</hi> Nehem. 13.22. How famouſe vnto all ages, are thoſe Godly Kings, <hi>Hezekiah, Ioſiah,</hi> &amp; the reſt, for Reformers of Religion, &amp; for Reſtorers of the worſhip of God! Oh that your zeale, might equall
<pb facs="tcp:21140:4"/>theirs; that it might be left as a monument, vnto all poſterity, that you Reſtored the worſhip of God in his Sacred Sabbaths.</p>
            <p>If I be able to compare them, none of your Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, did euer leaue the like honourable fact, to this, vpon recorde; vnleſſe it were they, that made the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from Popiſh Idolatry: and that indeed, may be compared with this: for that, concerned the 2th Com. and this, concernes the 4th Com. that, was a Morall Law; and ſo is this: that was touching a parte of Gods worſhip, in the firſt Table, and ſo is this. Two Morall Laws, to wit, the 2th Com. and the 4th Com. haue bene corrupted, for many hundreth yeers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the one, by Image worſhiping  the other by Sabbath breaking: as for the former, that hath (by the Mercy of God) bene reformed, this hundreth yeers, and vpwards, euer ſince we departed from Rome; and Gods bleſſing, hath abundantly followed our Church, euer ſince. As for the latter, we ſtill ſticke faſt in the myre; and remaine ſtill in ignorance &amp; blindneſſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with Rome, to this day; and this, waiteth for the Reformation of our Engliſh <hi>Nehemiah, Hezekiah,</hi> or <hi>Joſiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it was with the good Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> in reſtauration of Religion, ſtill they left ſomething vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; So our Anceſtours, though they reformed the corruptions about the 2th Com. yet they left the high places, I meane the prophanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lords Sabbaths, ſtill vntouched. No doubt, God foreſaw it, that the reformation of one of his Commandements, was worke enough, for thoſe his ſeruants, in thoſe gaine-ſaying times; the reformation of the other, he hath reſerued for theſe later times: oh that theſe times, might be ſo happie, as to take the Time! Let not poſterity, take this
<pb facs="tcp:21140:5"/>Crowne &amp; glory: The reſtauration, of the integrity of Gods worſhip, and the raiſing vp againe, of Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathes, call for your Maieſties helpe: Helpe O King.</p>
            <p>Tis true, innovations are dangerouſe, yet in ſome caſe neceſſary; as we ſee by new lawes daily inacted: But this is no innovation, it is but the reuiuing of an old Law, a long time laine dead; and the putting into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, Gods 4th Comm. now, and of long time out of vſe. Neither can it be thought a thing impoſſible, to be done, or diſaduantageouſe vnto your Realme: for the change of the Sabbath, from the Sunday, backe againe to the Saturday, that holy Day Gen. 2.3. will not proue (I ſuppoſe) one farthing loſſe, vnto your Subiectes: and for your Maieſtie, it is but your pleaſure; ſay the word onely, &amp; it is done; your Maieſties proclamation or the like, workes a preſent Reformation: Let me ſay vnto your Highneſſe therefore, as once thoſe ſeruants of <hi>Naaman</hi> ſaid vnto their Lord, when the Prophet bad him, but this ſmale &amp; eaſy thing, <hi>Goe waſh, and be cleane:</hi> If it were a great thing, which the Lord requireth of thee, wouldeſt thou not haue done it? how much rather when he ſaith vnto thee, waſh &amp; be cleane? 2. King. 5.13. I leaue the application. To conclude, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of the Lord is, to <hi>inquire for the old way,</hi> Ier. 6.16. be pleaſed therefore, to ſerch the Scriptures; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of your reuerend Biſhops, and lerned Clergy; as they will anſwer it before God, if this be not the old way, and the way wherein we muſt walke, to the Worlds end.</p>

            <p>RIGHT Reuerent Fathers in God, &amp; right gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſe &amp; honourable Lords; I preſume to offer this Treatiſe of the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> vnto your graue &amp; iudicious conſiderations; as vnto whom it doth more principally appertaine, to weigh &amp; determine, of queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; controuercies, of ſuch great conſequence; and whoſe it is, in a moſt eminent manner, to ſee that all corruptions in Gods worſhip be reformed; all Truethes of God, foſtered &amp; cheriſhed; and all the partes of Gods worſhip, duly &amp; religiouſly obſerued.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other things in this Treatiſe, I humbly deſire your Lordſhipes, to take theſe fiue, into your beſt &amp; deepeſt conſiderations: 1. That that Sacred or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Gods Sabbath (then the which, is not any in our Church more ancient; commanded by God in his Morall Law; ratified by Chriſt the Sonne of God; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by the Apoſtles; &amp; alſo by the primitiue Churches after them, for 300 or 400 yeeres together) is now ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully trampled vnder foote, &amp; prophaned. 2. That the Decalogue, &amp; 10 Commandements of Almighty God, are not wholly and fully taught and maintained in our Church, but onely by partes &amp; by peeces. 3. That God hath not his whole &amp; intire worſhip &amp; ſeruice, preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the firſt Table of the Decalogue, but is denied one fourth part thereof weekly. 4. That Gods 4th com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, is by the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doctrine in our Church, wholly fruſtrate and nullified, both roote and branch. 5. That by very many in our Church, there is groſſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition committed, Gods worſhip corrupted, yea plaine Idolatry wrought: and that by ſanctifying of the
<pb facs="tcp:21140:6"/>Lords day, for a Sabbath day, by the 4th Com. Theſe things (as I beleeue) you ſhall find cleerly proued in this Booke.</p>
            <p>Vnto whoſe conſideration ſhould I commend theſe things, for redreſſe, if not vnto your Lordſhipes? hath not his Maieſtie therefore deputed you, vnto your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall charges, to ouerſee, &amp; ſee to the well ordering of the Church, &amp; worſhip of God? and hath not the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, laied it vpon you, <hi>To warne ſome, that they teach none other doctrine,</hi> 1. Tim. 1.3? And, <hi>To redreſse the things that are amiſse:</hi> Or, <hi>To ſet in order, the things that are wanting,</hi> Tit. 1.5? Downe then with that <hi>Idoll,</hi> the Lords day Sabbath: ſo dealt <hi>Hezekiah</hi> with the Brazen <hi>Serpent,</hi> when idolatrouſly abuſed: and bring into its roome, &amp; into the Church of God againe, that ancient ordinance, Gods Sacred Saturday-Sabbath; let not an idoll of mans deuiſeing, ſtand in Gods Church, where an ordinance of Gods, inioyned by a Morall Law, ſhould ſtand.</p>
            <p>Oh my honourable Lords, what a pitty it is, to ſee Antiquity, true and honourable Antiquity, I meane the Lords Sabbathes, troden vnder foote! why ſhould not our Church, become followers of thoſe Ancienteſt, and moſt pure Churches, of the primitiue times, that liued next after Chriſt, &amp; his bleſſed Apoſtles, in obſeruation of the Lords Sabbath? Who, ſo long as they retained their greateſt purity, ſo long they religiouſly obſerued the Saturday-Sabbath. Why ſhould not your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipes, exhorte vnto the obſeruation of the Sabbath day, as did that Godly Biſhop <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his time? <hi>Epiſt. ad Magneſi.</hi> And why ſhould not your Lordſhips, defend the Sabbath day, as did that famouſe Biſhop <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in his time? Centur. iiij. cap. 6. pag. 410. This done, the Law of God ſhould be taught and maintained, in our
<pb facs="tcp:21140:6"/>Church, in its integrity and perfection; the 4th Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement ſhould be in vſe, amongſt vs againe; and be accounted as Morall, as any of the other nyne: and God ſhould haue his whole &amp; intire worſhip, preſcribed in the firſt Table, as well amongſt vs, as euer he had among the Iewes, when they were the onely people of God. If it pleaſe not God, to inkindle your Lordſhipes hearts, with more zeale for his glory, in this behalfe, then is to be found among common Miniſters; Gods Sabbaths, are like ſtill (which God forbid) to lay waſte, his Lawes to be partially taught, and his intire worſhip, to be ſtill denied him.</p>
            <p>Let none ſuggeſt vnto your Lordſhips, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the ancient Sabbath, is Iudaiſme: for <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> liuing in thoſe firſt ages of the Chriſtian Churches, taketh away this obiection, ſaying, <hi>Wee keepe the Sabbath day, and yet we are not tainted with Iudaiſme,</hi> Centur. iiij. In the Booke of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> after the 4th Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement (wherein the old Sabbath day, is by name ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified) is publikly rehearſed by the Miniſter, we are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to vſe this deuout prayer, <hi>Lord haue mercy vpon vs, &amp; incline our hearts to keepe this Law.</hi> Which prayer, &amp; which commandement, cannot (vnder your Lordſhips correction) be vnderſtood of the Lords day, nor of any other day, but the old Sabbath day onely: Wherefore, the obſeruation of the old Sabbath, is no Iudaiſme; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we be taught, to pray to God, to incline our hearts to Iudaiſme. It is not vnknowne vnto your Lordſhips, that not many yeeres ſince, the <hi>Croſſe</hi> in Baptiſme, hath by ſome bene counted idolatrouſe, &amp; the <hi>holy dayes,</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, &amp; yet hath our Church freed them from ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations; I truſt therefore, that in your graue &amp; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſe conſultations, it will be iudged meete, that the Lords Sabbaths, ſhall be alſo freed from the ſlaunder of
<pb facs="tcp:21140:7"/>Iewiſh, Iudaiſme, and the like: If the Holy dayes of the Saints, may be defended, I truſt the Holie day of the Holie one of Iſrael, ſhall be protected.</p>
            <p>I haue done myne errand, I haue diſcharged my duety; the cauſe is no longer myne, then in my breaſt; I now commend it vnto your Lordſhips, for protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the cauſe is Gods; and therefore youres, and the Churches; it deſerueth the patronag of the greateſt, &amp; of the lernedeſt.</p>
            <p>Tis true, my perſon is meane; I care not though it be fleited, ſo the cauſe be honoured: Iudges, regard not perſones; but Cauſes.</p>
            <p>In Courtes of Iuſtice, if any ſewe or informe for the King, if the Kings Title, be in queſtion, though the <hi>Informer</hi> be meane &amp; neglected, yet the Cauſe is much regarded; for it hath all the honour &amp; furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that the Iudges &amp; Courte, can afford it: in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſorte, the Iudges, they take in with it, &amp; mannage it, as if it were their owne: Counſaile ſhall be aſſigned to pleade for it; other cauſes ſhall ſtand by, whilſt it be tried; informer &amp; witneſſes, ſhall be countenanced, &amp; incouraged to ſpeake, &amp; the like; ſo as if poſſible, the Kings Title ſhall get the day. Let me petition your Lordſhips therfore, in your Triall of this Controuercy, to haue regard whoſe the Title is, that is in queſtion: it being the <hi>Lords Sabbath;</hi> a branch of the Morall Law; a parte of Gods worſhip; and one of the moſt ancient ordinances, that euer God eſtabliſhed in his Church; the Title is plainly Gods therfore: yea, it is called the <hi>Sabbath of the Lord,</hi> or the Lords Sabbath, and, <hi>myne Holy Day.</hi> The Title being Gods then, let it haue that fauourable and honourable triall, in your Synods, Conſiſtories, &amp; Conſciences, the which earthly Kings Titles obtaine, in their Courtes. Who euer make
<pb facs="tcp:21140:7"/>ſquemiſh of it, your Lordſhips, as Iudges wil take in with it I truſt; knowing, the Title of him is now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; of whom you hold all you inioy for the preſent, and hope to inioy hereafter: let the day be Gods; let iudgement paſſe on his ſide, if poſſible; let the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, haue incouragment &amp; countenance; all helpes &amp; furtherances; if not for his owne ſake, yet for his Cauſe ſake; and for Gods ſake; hee, pleads the Kings broad Seale, an expreſſe precept; the 4th Com. one of the 10 Morales; and one of the Firſt Table too; what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or higher Euidence can be demanded?</p>
            <p>Let no argument, or Text of Scripture be vrged, to the aboliſhing of this ordinance of Gods Sabbath; to the impairing, &amp; ecclipſing of the Morall Law, &amp; 10 Commandements; and to the ouerturning of any parte of Gods worſhip, once eſtabliſhed in his Church, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they may be ſalued and anſwered, by any warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or expoſition: Nor let any anſwer paſſe for orthodox, wherby any iote or title of the Decalogue, or any parte of Gods worſhip, ſhould be denied: This, I humbly begg and craue of our Lordſhips, and that in the name of God, whoſe Title I informe for; and whoſe Title you are to iudge for, and defend; and that by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of your places, &amp; high offices. For I hold it as an vndoubted <hi>Maxime,</hi> that it is not godly, nor Lawfull, to aboliſh an ordinance of Gods, being a parte of Gods worſhip, once eſtabliſhed in his Church, &amp; preſcribed in his Morall Law; vnleſſe ſome moſt pregnant Text, can be brought againſt it, which doth <hi>neceſſarily</hi> &amp; moſt cleerly aboliſh it, ſo as it can be no wayes anſwered; of which kind (vnder your Lordſhips correction be it ſpoken) I know there is not any one Text that can be ſhowne, in all the New Teſtament: Now God forbid, that any of his ordinances, ſhould be throwne downe,
<pb facs="tcp:21140:8"/>when they may (if we pleaſed) be ſtill retained.</p>
            <p>It may eaſily be thought, that in ſo large a Treatiſe as this is, wherein is handled ſo many arguments, &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, paſſages, &amp; particles, &amp; that in a new Argument, not formerly wrote of by any, that ſome or others of them may ſauour of humane frailty; &amp; ſtand in neede of further ſtudy; I craue of your Lordſhips, that ſuch a thing may not be racked &amp; dwelt vpon, but that the body of the Treatiſe, &amp; maine Argument, arguments &amp; anſwers may be attended; the which are ſo cleere &amp; ſound (to my vnderſtanding) as I am good Confident, the cauſe ſhall obtaine your Lordſhips Patronage.</p>
            <p>So demeane your ſelues, in deciding, iudging, and defending Gods Title, here on earth; that when the Lord Ieſus, that chiefe Shepheard &amp; <hi>Byſhop</hi> of our ſoules ſhall appeare, then you may receiue, an <hi>Incorruptible Crowne of glory.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:21140:10"/>whom I communicated my Notes, for confirmation or confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they did neither; but rather turned my vtter enemies, for this cauſe ſake? wherefore I was not raſh, as ſome men count raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, but after I had waited, as <hi>Elihu</hi> did, vpon the auncient and more lerned, &amp; found no courage in their heartes, nor word in their mouthes, to ſpeake for God; then I ſpake in my turne, &amp; ſhewed myne opinion: let no man blame my zeale; it was for God.</p>
            <p>Tis true, the meanneſſe of my perſon, will be a greate blocke in the way, to the progreſſe of this cauſe; eſpecially in theſe clym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dayes, wherein the word of God, is ſo much receiued, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons; for men eſteeme of the cauſe, iuſt as they doe of the perſon: hence it is, that before many will giue audience to the matter, they will firſt know of the man; as, whither he be one of their ſide or no, &amp; approued of by them: and whither learned, witty, eloquent, and well red, or no: or whither honoured with Titles, eminency, and preferment or no: in ſo much as, if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos</hi> were now liuing, and teaching Gods trueth, it is to be feared, his <hi>booke</hi> of prophecy, would not be regarded, being he was a Neat-heard: and if S. Paul, were now to preach the <hi>new</hi> doctrine of the goſpell, it may be thought, it would not be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, he being a Tayler or Tentmaker: But where are thoſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bereanes,</hi> who ſerched the Scriptures, and examined the cauſe, without regard had to Pauls perſon? where is that Eloquent and lerned <hi>Apollos,</hi> that gaue heed vnto the inſtructions, and matter which <hi>Aquilla,</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> his wife, taught him; of whom he lerned the way of God more perfectly, without reſpect vnto their perſones? for the one was a woman that taught him; and both, were Taylers of Tentmakers: If therefore A Trueth, fareth the worſe, for the meanneſſe of the Author, it ſhall be ſo, but at the hands onely of ſuch perſons, as doe not vnfeinedly deſire the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milke of the word, that they may growe thereby, as did thoſe Noble Bereanes; and it ſhall be ſo, but at the hands onely of ſuch whoſe lerning is not ſanctified, and ſeaſoned with Humility, as <hi>Apollos</hi> his was.</p>
            <p>Some obiect, that the broching of this point, will breed ſtirres, and diſtractions in the Church &amp;c. To whom I anſwer, tis a trueth they ſay: when euer entred any new Trueth, or was, any
<pb facs="tcp:21140:10"/>old Trueth receiued, but it came in with ſtirres and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at the firſt? It fareth in theſe caſes, as it doth with phiſicke, which a ſikly man takes to recouer his health; at firſt, it makes him ſicker then he was before, it cauſeth him pains in his belly, head, &amp; heart &amp;c: and albeit the pacient know all this before hand, yet will he take this potion, in hope of a more perfect health afterwards: and ſo I truſt will it be in this caſe: though for the preſent, it occationeth ſtirres, diſtractions, &amp; diſtempers; yet, it will be ſo onely, in the minds of ſome ſuch, as doe abound with euill humores: neuertheleſſe, the concluſion will be good, by the mercy of God; &amp; a more perfect health will be obtained. When <hi>Luther</hi> firſt ſtirred, to reforme the ſecond Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there was then greate ſtirres and diſtractions in the Church, but by this time, and long agone; there hath bene a ſweete ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, &amp; that vpon better conditions then formerly: and why may wee not hope for like ſucceſſe? I mary ſay ſome ſcoffingly, and we ſhall haue an other Luther now, ſhall we? what will you proue an other Luther now? ſuch a diſdainfull, enuiouſe, &amp; ſcoffing age we now liue in that, that which ſhold be a mans greateſt honour, as to imitate the moſt virtuouſe; it is wreſted, as a matter of his reproch &amp; deriſion: in other caſes, we deſire to iuſtifie our actions, by the like actions, of the godly and wiſe that haue gone before vs, and to make vſe of them for our incouragement, and why ſhould I onely be denied this benefit? I pray tell me, is it not a laudable thing, for any to become followers of <hi>Luther, Caluîne, Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius? of Paul, Peter, Chriſt?</hi> When euer I propound examples to my ſelfe, they ſhall euer be the beſt, and moſt eminent; let theſe ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers imitate the worſt: for ſo they doe, they are the ſonnes of ſcoffing <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> Were it an infallible note of pride, to imitate the moſt excellent, Paul would neuer haue exhorted vs, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come followers of <hi>him</hi> as he was of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Neither could Chriſtians be accounted humble men, becauſe they doe imitate Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Some obiect thus, I but you doe not diſcreetly, to publiſh this point, whereby it comes to the peoples knowledge; rather ſhould a drope of blood, haue gone from my heart, then ſuch a point as this, vnto common people: you ſhould rather haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted it vnto Diuines in priuate, and diſcuſſed it with them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:21140:11"/>&amp;c. Hereto I anſwer, this obiection of ſome Diuines, it is no better then a faire flouriſh, whereby vnder a c lour of diſcretion, they would haue ſilenced, and buried this Trueth euerlaſtingly. For if they could haue tied me, by the rules of this their diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to haue made knowne this point, onely vnto Miniſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, they then know waies enough, how to ſmother it, ſo as it ſhould neuer haue come to light, and ſo as the people, poore ſoules, ſhould neuer haue heard of it.</p>
            <p>Indeed. I iudged it diſcretion, firſt to make tender of it to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, before I printed, to the viewe of common people; and ſo I did; for I ſent my Notes a broad, to ſondry Diuines of the beſt ranke, both nere and afarr off, expecting their confutation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, but I obtained neither: In caſe they had anſwered me, by way of confirmation, then my reſolution was, to haue bene further counſailed by them as touching the publiſhing of it; as whither by my ſelfe; or rather by ſome more eminent &amp; able perſon of their chooſing: and touching the time, when? whither preſently, or rather hereafter: and for the perſones, to whom? whither generally vnto all, or rather vnto ſome eminent perſons of the Kingdome; and the like. But expecting longe their anſweres, which diuers of them promiſed, though they performed not; and waiting 10 or 12 monethes, and finding nothing but delaies, and foording me off ſtill; hereby I ſuſpected, that this their counſaile of diſcretion, was but a dry morſell to ſtay my ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make withall for the preſent, and nothing elſe but a fained thing; deuiſed handſomly to make mee beleeue on the one ſide, that, that they meant ſeriouſly and faithfully, to haue taken the matter into their conſideration, had not I bene ſo raſh in publiſhing it, which they neuer meant, as all experience euen to this day ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: for both my Notes then, and my Booke ſince, haue neuer bene anſwered by them by way of confutation; nor approued of them, by way of confirmation. And on the other ſide, to haue kept this Trueth ſecret, from the peoples knowledge: and this of the twaine indeed, is that they chiefly aime at: it is moſt grieuouſe vnto them, that common people, ſhould eſpie their errours: as for their owne conſciences, many of them are large enough (as I haue experience, to my exceding greate ſorrow of heart) to brooke the ſuperſtitiouſe, and ignorant obſeruation, of the Lords day
<pb facs="tcp:21140:11"/>Sabbath; and to neglect the worſhip of God, in the 7th day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: they could digeſt theſe things, and ſet downe with them, good quietly, prouided no body might ſee this their blind igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp; halting with God; but this is that which toucheth to the quicke with them; that ſince my publication of this Trueth, and diſcouery of their errour, now they cannot halt in ſecret; now common people, ſee thers no grownds for the Lords day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; now their pariſhoners &amp; others, can anſwer their arguments; and ſee their folly and leu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty; and how a long time they haue bene carried in a golding dreame. Well, when I ſaw that Miniſters ſleited Gods Trueth, then I reſolued to turne me, and open my ſelfe vnto the people, truſting to finde more fidelity &amp; ſincerity among them: if therfore it griueth them, that the people know of it ſooner then they would, let them thank themſelues, for ſleiting of it, when tendered vnto them; and for their attempts to ſmother it &amp;c. For ſome of them haue ſaid vnto me, when I haue moued them in it moſt ceriouſly, what thinke you, wee haue nothing elſe to doe, but to liſten to your toies?</p>
            <p>Others obiect ſaying, if I would haue wrote in controuercy, I ſhold haue wrote againſt Papiſts, as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> &amp; the like, againſt a forraine enemy &amp;c. To whom I anſwer, thers more neede to deale at home, then a broad: euery man flies vpon A Papiſt: for the controuercy is made eaſy by the many helpes of our lerned writers; &amp; becauſe it is applauded at all hands, ſo as a man may be a gainer by the controuercy: But fewe or none will medle, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe things at home: for theſe are not onely hard &amp; difficult, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring much ſtudy &amp; greate labours conſidering none haue gone before to giue them light; but alſo, a man may eaſily foreſee it, hee ſhall be a loſer by the bargaine: wherby you may eaſily gather, that homebred euiles, are more perillouſe, and like to ſtick longe by vs, without reformation: now by how much the fewer will vndertake them, by ſo much the better ſeruice he doth vnto God, that will aduenture himſelfe in them: for this is that I aime at, not to pleaſe men, but him that hath called me, and betruſted me with one of his Talents; my chiefe deſire now is, that I may improue it, not which way my ſelfe may beſt gaine credit, wealth, and preferment, but that way whereby I may wine moſt glorie, to my chiefe Lord and Maſter. Let none thinke me ſo ignorant, but that I know
<pb facs="tcp:21140:12"/>well enough, which is the way to riſe in the world, were that the thing I ſhort at; and I know right well, that whilſt I am in this argument, I am cleane out of that way: but with <hi>Moſes,</hi> I haue a reſpect vnto the Recompenſe of reward.</p>
            <p>Some of them obiect vnto me, that by ſtiring in this point, I ſhall incenſe the State, and the Byſhopes will moleſt me &amp;c. To whom I anſwer, thats the thing indeed would much pleaſe them, that the Governement of the Kingdome, would oppoſe mee, &amp; ſo much they intimate, by their much wondering, that I am ſo long ſuffered in quiet &amp;c: for ſince they cannot defend the phantaſy of the Lords day Sabbath, by the Scriptures, and ſword of the Spirit, now they long for the aide of the ſword of the Magiſtrate, wondering it tarrieth ſo long erre it will aueng them: but had I their cauſe in hand, I would be aſhamed, to deſire aide from the ſword of the Magiſtrate, when the word of God, and ſword of the Spirit, refuſeth to help: firſt let them ſoundly anſwer, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute my booke, and then let them flie to the Magiſtrat and ſpare not. I know well, that things tending to changes and alterations, are not pleaſing vnto Statſmen, vnleſſe in caſe moſt weighty, and of vrgent neceſſity, of which kind, I truſt they will Iudge this to be, after they haue once taken it, into their graue and iudiciouſe conſiderations. The ſoundneſſe and cleerneſſe of this my cauſe, giueth me good hope, that God will inlighten them with it, &amp; ſo incline their hearts vnto mercy; but if not, ſince I verily beleeue and know it to be a Trueth; and my duety, not to ſmother it, and ſuffer it to dye with mee, I haue aduentured to publiſh it, &amp; to defend it, ſaying with Quene <hi>Aeſter, If</hi> I <hi>periſh,</hi> I <hi>periſh:</hi> and with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> I <hi>paſse not at all, neither is my life deare vnto mee, ſo that</hi> I <hi>may fulfill my courſe with ioye,</hi> Actor. 20.24. What a corziue would it prove to my conſcience, on my deaths bedd, to cale to minde, how I knew theſe things full well, but would not reueale them; how could I ſay with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that I had reuealed the <hi>whole</hi> Counſaile of God, and haue kept <hi>nothing</hi> backe, that was proffitable? Act. 20.20.27. what hope could I then conceiue, that God would open his gate of Mercy to mee, who whilſt I liued, would not open my mouth for him?</p>
            <p>Thus Gentle Reader, I haue both giuen thee my reaſons mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to wright, and alſo ſhowne thee, the many diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

Touching Method, I could wiſh that here and there, ſome things were otherwiſe placed; but conſidering, that nothing is more tediouſe vnto me, then vnneceſſary wrighting of one thing twiſe ouer, whereby ſuch ſlipes might haue bene amended, I truſt I ſhall obtaine thy patience; and the rather, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that after this worke was firſt finiſhed, it laying ſtill by mee, I had occation to add too many and ſondry things here and there, and not finding roome enough in the margent of my Notes, to inſerte them were I would, was forced to thruſt them in where I could.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas in ſome paſſages, a harſh word or two may fale from my pen, which the temperate Reader may thinke, might better haue bene ſpared; In this caſe, I deſire him to thinke, that he is not yet ſo ſenſible of the foulneſſe of the cauſe, as my ſelfe, who haue peraduenture better weighed circumſtances: for I conſider of the foulnes of the matter, ſeeing it moſt palpably; of the obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the aduerſaries, after ſufficient meanes of conviction, tendered long a gone vnto them; and of the dangerouſe conſequences, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from their greate errours, in a matter of greateſt weight and moment, it being about a Morall Law, a parte of Gods worſhip, and a moſt Ancient ordinance of Gods; I ſee their abſurd anſwers, diſtinctons, and arguments, and how by their ſubtilty they corrupt, the Scriptures, and abuſe the well minded people of the Land: obſerue it, and you ſhall ſtill find ſome of theſe things, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going occation of euery tarte ſpeech I vſe; now theſe things, my Reader at firſt, cannot be poſſeſſed of, as I am: &amp; who can ſpeake of ſuch foule things, without ſome expreſſions, of a iuſt indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt them?</p>
            <p>In ſpecialll, I haue often occaſion to vſe the word <hi>Puritan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:21140:13"/>ſome men with whom I haue to deale, rather then others; &amp; grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued I am at my heart and in my ſoule, that I muſt haue to deale againſt perſons ſo qualified.</p>
            <p>Tis true this cauſe concerneth all men none excepted, whither Miniſters or people: yet in ſpeciall, as cauſe there is for it, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect my ſpeech chiefly againſt Miniſters; of Miniſters there are two ſortes, puritanes, and ſuch as are no puritanes; theſe, as I find them not redy to imbrace things new; ſo I find them, not redy to condemne a cauſe, before they haue heard it: wherefore, ſpareing them, my ſpeech is onely againſt puritane Miniſters: of theſe alſo there are two ſortes, ſome who happily neuer ſo much as haue heard of this queſtion, or if they haue, yet neuer raiſed ſlaunders &amp; oppoſitions againſt it; but carying it temperatly and diſcreetly, wiſh it a due triall, that ſo the trueth may be boulted out, theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I reuerence: but there are others, &amp; in ſpeciall thoſe tenn Miniſters named in the title leaſe, at the begining of this booke, theſe men in ſpeciall I oppoſe; for theſe after they haue had my Notes, and alſo my former booke and conference with me, now fowre yeeres paſt, yet ſtill doe raiſe vp all the oppoſiton, againſt both my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and my cauſe; that they can; and that both publikly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly. Salomon telleth vs, there is an appointed time for all things, A time to laugh, and a time to weepe: A time to rend, and a time to ſowe: A time of warre, and a time of peace: A Time to keepe ſilence, and a time to ſpeake Eccl. 3. my former booke was a time of ſilence: for there I laboured, to couer the ſpotes &amp; blemiſhes, of theſe my brethrens errour, hoping a word had bene enough to the wiſe; but they abuſing it, this booke is a time to ſpeake, and lay them forth in their cullers. My former booke, was a time of peace, for there I handled the matter meekly, mildly, and in all frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dlineſſe, hoping theſe my brethren, would redly haue imbraced Trueth with peace; but they proclaiming open warres againſt me, &amp; Gods cauſe in my hand; this booke is a time of warre; &amp; here I take them for Gods enimies and myne: Let me deſire my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therfore, to giue me patience, to proſecute theſe enemies of Gods Trueth rowndly, not ſparing them, though they be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
            <p>Happily thou wilt ſay in their behalfe, oh but theſe men whom you would ſo proſecute, they are Miniſters, whom we excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb facs="tcp:21140:13"/>reuerence, and who doe truly feare God, as your ſelfe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny &amp;c. Yea, they are your brethren, &amp;c. And ſo doe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence them too, but with this limitation, in their virtues, and wherin they doe well: And they truly feare God, as I am ſtrongly perſwaded, yet they haue not at all times, a reſpect vnto all Gods Commandements, as the Prophet Dauid ſpeaketh; for they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the 4th Com. weekly, by prophaning of Gods Sabbathes: I may not vnfitly reſemble theſe 10 Miniſters, vnto that clowd which had a light and a darke parte; when I behold their light parte, &amp; ſee them walking in &amp; teaching the trueth, I cannot loke enough on them, I may truly ſpeake it: but when I looke on their darke parte, and ſee them in their errours, I abhorre their ſight, as one abhorreth the darkneſſe. The Prophet Dauid was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly reuerenced, yet not in his ſinnes of murther &amp; adultery, againſt the 6th &amp; 7th com. Hee truly feared God, yet at this time, he had not a reſpect vnto theſe two Commandements, of murther and adultery. The Apoſtle Peter, being a Miniſter, was to be highly reuerenced, yet not in his deniall of Chriſt: He truly feared God, yet when he forſwore his Lord and Maſter, therein he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraied it not. Let good men therfore, &amp; Holy, be defended, no further, then their goodneſſe and holineſſe will extend; and ſuffer them to be proſecuted and diſcouered, in their erroures &amp; ſinnes, that they may reforme them. I confeſſe they are my brethren, &amp; ſo I acknowledge them; but what then, may not their erroures therfore be diſcouered and reproued? Peter was Pauls brother, did Paul therfore cloke Peters errour? no; Paul diſcouered it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued it to his face, and that publikly before all men Gal. 2.11.14: ſhall the ſinnes of the people be reproued, and not the ſinnes of Miniſters? ſhall Miniſters, haue a patent to ſinne without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profe? our Sauiour, reproued <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying, get thee behind me <hi>Satan.</hi> I hold, ſinne is leſſe to be borne withall in a Miniſter, then in a priuate perſon; eſpecially if it be, both in their life and doctrine, as that is, for which I ſhall reproue them: for when they not onely practiſe it, but alſo erroniouſly teach it, hereby they draw whole multitudes after them; and therefore ſinnefull errour, would be ſnibed in them, as a riuer would be ſtopped in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>Perhapes thou wilt further ſay for them, but what is it you
<pb facs="tcp:21140:14"/>haue againſt them? it ſeemeth by theſe words, that you haue ſome greate matter againſt them, which we cannot beleeue, ſince we know them to be men ſo Holy, ſo lerned, and euery way ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, as we cannot ſay, black is their eye &amp;c. Why amongſt others, theſe things I haue againſt them; In generall I challeng them, for their falſe and erroniouſe doctrine, where with all they haue now a long time deceiued, and ſeduced the people of God, &amp; wherein they ſtill ſtifly perſiſt, he particulars whereof are theſe; by their vngodly and abhominable reiecting, of that moſt ancient ordinance, of Gods Sabbath, by name commanded in the Morall Law. 1. They are become companiones to thoſe wicked. <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who were <hi>partiall</hi> in Gods <hi>Law,</hi> Mal. 2.9: for they deny the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity &amp; perfection of the Law, and teach it onely by halues &amp; by parceles and peeces, and ſo make Gods Law, a lame and defectiue Law. 2. They deny God, a parte of his holy worſhip and ſeruice, preſcribed in the firſt Table of the Decalogue, and this they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and omit weekly. 3. They haue vtterly aboliſhed, and by their doctrine nullified, the whole 4th Commandement, both roote and branch. 4. They haue moſt ſhamefully abuſed the 4th Commandement, by their moſt groſſe, falſe, and erroniouſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of it; ſo as I neuer ſaw, any one portion of ſcripture, more corruptly and falſly expounded, by any Popiſh Ieſuit. Whereby they worthily deſerue the Title, to be called, <hi>The corrupters of Gods Law.</hi> 5. They doe ſhamefully abuſe certaine Textes, and portions of Scripture; and that by ſetting Scriptures together by the eares: for they wreſt certaine Scriptures of the New Teſtament, to the vnneceſſary contradicting and ouerthrowing, of things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Decalogue and 10 Commandements of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 6. They haue and doe, moſt vnſchollarlike, abuſe the 4th Com. by applying it, to the Lords day, the which God directed properly vnto the Saturday, or 7th day of the weeke. 7. They teach and maintaine, that the <hi>Lords day</hi> is the Sabbath day, by Chriſt his inſtitution; and to this purpoſe, they haue moſt vnler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly &amp; diſhoneſtly, wreſted and abuſed, diuerſe &amp; ſondry por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones of ſacred Scripture, a thing which one day they muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to God for: and hereby they haue ſhamefully abuſed, many of the well affected people of the land, nurſing them vp in Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, will worſhip, and idolatry: If I ſhall make theſe 7 things
<pb facs="tcp:21140:14"/>good, againſt theſe 10 Miniſters, as in this booke I ſhall, then I truſt you will pardon me, if now and then, I let fale an harſh word or two, againſt them; and then I truſt you will not blame me, for taking vp the bucklers againſt them, as Gods enemies, in theſe caſes: I could not haue taken theſe things ſo euilly, at the hands of any as of puritans, nor of any puritans as of puritane Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: for at their hands I looked for better.</p>
            <p>As for them, theſe 10 Miniſters, I require and charge them, as they will anſwer it before the Tribunall of Almightie God, at the generall day of Iudgement, that they ſtudy the 4th Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment better, and other the Scriptures now in controuercy; ſo that they may deliuer nothing to the people, but the pure word of God, in their expoſition; and that they forbeare theſe erroniouſe doctrines, in pulpit and in priuate; yea and reuoke theſe their foule erroures, making a mends to the people of God, whom they haue wronged, by acknowledging the ſame vnto them, before either they, or any of their people departe this preſent life: it is no dallying with mens ſoules, and Gods matters.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21140:18"/>commanded in the morall law, counting it for a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and aboliſhed; by reiection whereof, they reiect ſome thing commanded in the Law; and ſo conſequently they are partiall in the law, and doe deny it in its integrity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: vrge an Anabaptiſt or Antinomian to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Sabbath day, and he will anſwere you, that the law is aboliſhed at the comming of Chriſt, as all thoſe legall Ceremonies were: vrge a Proteſtant or a Papiſt to ſanctify the Sabbath day, and your anſwere ſhall be, that this part of the law touching the Sabbath day, is a ceremonie and aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at the coming of Chriſt: thus Anabaptiſtes and Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians renounce the whole law; Proteſtants and Papiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the wholeneſſe of the law; the one would haue no law, the other would haue no perfect law: Againſt both theſe this booke is penned.</p>
                     <p>The partes of this booke are ſixe, diuided into ſo many Chapters alſo. The firſt parte or chapter is in defenſe of the Morall Law, and conſequently of Gods Sabbathes, againſt Anabaptiſtes and Antinomianes. (The other fiue partes or Chapters, are in defenſe of the integrity and perfection of the Law, and conſequently of Gods Sabbathes, againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes and Papiſtes: for this purpoſe) the ſecond parte or Chapter, giueth the true ſenſe and Expoſition of the fourth Command. and vindicateth it from the common and corrupt gloſſes and expoſitions of it. The third Chapter, ſheweth the weakneſſe and inſufficiency of all thoſe Scriptures and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are vſually produced to proue the Lords day to be a Sabbath day. The fourth Chapter, ſheweth the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and feebleneſſe of all thoſe Scriptures and arguments, which are vſually alleaged againſt the Lords Sabbath of the ſeuenth day, or Saturday, to make it an aboliſhed ceremony. The fifth Chapter, conteineth ſondry forcible and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable arguments and Scriptures, prouing the morallity and perpetuity of the ancient Sabbath day. The ſixte and laſt Chapter, conteineth a Diſpenſation for a ſeaſon, touching the preſent practiſe, and obſeruation of the ſeuenth day Sabbath: together with an Exhortation, to a ſpeedy reformation. Thus
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21140:18"/>you ſee my taske what it is; my aduerſaries who they are; and the partes of this Booke.</p>
                     <p>One thing more would be premiſed; for ſo much as we ſhall often haue occaſion to vſe theſe two words <hi>Morall</hi> and <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> it is ſit that I here ſhew in what ſenſe I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them. 1. I would vſe theſe words but for diſtinction ſake; for whereas there are two ſortes of Sabbathes; the wek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sabbath and the yeerly Sabbathes: the Sabbath which God wrote, and the Sabbathes which Moſes wrote: the Sabbath which God ſpake, and the Sabbathes which Moſes ſpake: the Sabbath written in the Morall law Exod. 20.8. and the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathes written in the Ceremoniall law Levit. 23.32. &amp;c. for the diſtinguiſhing of theſe two ſortes of Sabbathes one from the other, I doe vſe theſe two words, calling the weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath recorded in the Morall law, the <hi>Morall Sabbath;</hi> and the yeerly Sabbathes recorded in the Ceremoniall law, the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Sabbathes:</hi> theſe Sabbathes were alſo diſtinguiſhed in reſpect of time, the Morall Sabbath was firſt deliuered Exod. 20.8. yea, Gen. 2.2.3. the ceremoniall Sabbathes were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deliuered Levit. 23.32. &amp;c. neither did theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Sabbathes euer come within the pale of the Morall law, or were written in the Tables of ſtone. 2. I ſee not but that I may call the weekly Sabbath, the Morall Sabbath properly: for 1. the ſeuenth day or weekly Sabbath, it conſerneth prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe and manners, which is ſignified by the word Morall. 2. Since <hi>God ſpake all thoſe words</hi> Exod. 20.1. why ſhould not euery thing he ſpake be called morall, as well as any thing he ſpake? and ſince the Sabbath day or ſeuenth day, is a thing that is expreſly commanded in the Morall law, and which may, I ſay which may be retained in the Church with great profit, why ſhould it be denied the name of morall? 3. Giue me a reaſon why the ſeuenth day Sabbath ſhould not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Morall, as well as the doctrine of the Trinity in the firſt Com? or as the doctrine of originall ſinne, or luſt Rom. 7.7. in the tenth Comm? 4. Since the dueties of the Sabbath, to wit, Reſt, and Holy exerciſes, are accounted Morall, why ſhould not the time or ſeuenth day alſo be accounted morall;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21140:19"/>for the time is a furtherance vnto theſe morall dueties: now that which furthereth a morall ſhould me thinke be alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a morall. 5. Herevnto agreeth Doctour <hi>Ames</hi> in his Theologicall Theſis pag. 499. and alſo affirmeth it to be the iudgement of the <hi>best</hi> diuines, ſaying, <hi>It is receiued by all best diuines, that the Morales were differenced from the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niales, by this, that all (and onely) the Morales, were wrote by God, in the Tables of stones &amp;c.</hi> The Saturday and weekly Sabbath then, muſt needs be termed a morall Sabbath. In a word, why ſhould this be ſtrange? for as there is a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall law and a morall law, why may there not be likewiſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Sabbathes, and morall Sabbathes? and ſince God placed the ſeuenth day Sabbath in the morall law, among the morales, why ſhould it not be termed morall, and called the morall Sabbath?</p>
                     <p>The morall Sabbathes, together with whatſoeuer elſe is commanded in the morall law, I doe defend; the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Sabbathes, with all other Ceremonies, I doe reiect: It is the Decalogue, and nothing elſe, which I defend; and this I ſtand to maintaine, in the integrity and perfection thereof, vnto a iott and title. Theſe things premiſed, I come vnto the firſt thing propounded, namely the Defenſe of the Morall law, againſt Anabaptiſtes, Libertines, and Antinomianes.</p>

                     <p> Firſt then, as touching theſe who deny the morall law, I can but wonder, how any heart that hath the feare of God in it, can without trembling and aſtoniſhment admit ſo blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a thought as this, to enter it; as to thinke, that that moſt holy and righteouſe Law of God, hath nothing to doe with him, to command him, and to direct him how to order his liefe: Moſes ſpeaketh thus in commendation of this Law, ſaying, <hi>And what Nation is ſo great, that hath ordinances and lawes ſo righteous, as all this law, which I ſet before you this day?</hi> Deuteru. 4.8. and is it ſo righteous a law? how is it then that theſe men will attempt to aboliſh it? and deny obedience vnto it? our Sauiour telleth vs, that the ſumme of this Law, is <hi>to loue the Lord our God with all our hearts, ſoules, and might: and to loue our neighbour as our ſelues,</hi> Matt. 22.37. Can they ſhew vs any other law in ſteade of this, that is better, more holy, or more iuſt? Loue, is the ſumme of this law; and loue, is the law we ſhall vvalke by in the kingdome of heauen, 1. Corint. 13.8.13. and vvill they reiect that lavv on earth, vvhich vve ſhall vvalke by in the kingdome of heauen?</p>
                     <p>It may be they vvill ſay for themſelues, but the Morall lavv it is Moſes lavv, novv vve haue forſaken Moſes, vve cleaue vnto Chriſt, and vnto his Lavves in the Nevv Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp;c. But, 1. the ceremoniall lavv being vvritten by Moſes, it may be termed Moſes lavv, but the Morall Lavv being vvritten by the finger of God, it muſt be called Gods Lavv. 2. Make they a difference betvvixt the lavv vvritten in Exod. 20.1. &amp;c. and the ſame lavv ratified by Chriſt in the Nevv Teſtament? let them then ſhevv me a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvixt theſe tvvo; <hi>Honour thy father &amp; thy mother</hi> &amp;c.

If there then be no difference of the Morall lavv, vvhither in the ould or nevv Teſtament, in vaine doe they reiect the one to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the other.</p>
                     <p>Happily they vvill ſay againe, I but the lavv is of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſiue nature, compelling men to obedience: but Chriſtianes are indued vvith a free ſpirit, doeing things of loue: the loue

                     <p>One thing I would adde more, and it is an admonition vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any fearing God, and honouring his Sabbathes, who be leaning and but ſomewhat inclining vnto this wicked opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that as they loue and reuerence Gods Sabbathes, ſo they would beware of and ſhune this dangerous opinion, of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the law of God: for this I dare confidently affirme, take away this morall law, and away goeth all Sabbathes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: now take away Gods Sabbathes, and what a floud of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and prophanneſſe will forth with flovv in vpon vs, I leaue to be conſidered of by all the Godly wiſe: happily they may thinke to find ground and warrant enough in the New Teſtament, for a Sabbath, as namely for the Lords day, though the fourth comman. were abollſhed; but, that herein they are much miſtaken, and that no day can be vrged to be ſanctified for a Sabbath, vnleſſe it be by and from the fourth comm. ſhall abundantly appeare hereafter.

Furthermore, whereas the law may be conſidered two wayes, either with reſpect vnto Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or vnto obſeruation; vvee doe not defend the lavv to be in force vnto Iuſtification: for, <hi>by the workes of the law ſhall no fleſh be iustified,</hi> Rom. 3.20. we defend the lavv to be in force only vnto <hi>obſeruation,</hi> and for direction of vs how to walke, and to pleaſe God. Now then, that the law is in force vnto beleeuers, as a rule of obſeruation and direction, I proue it by theſe inſuing arguments and Scriptures.</p>

Hereby we ſee then, that the doctrine of faith, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21140:21"/>iuſtification by faith, doe not aboliſh the law: yea, ſo much the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly; <hi>doe wee then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>make the law of none effect through faith?</hi> Whence I thus argue, that if faith doth not make void the law, what ſhould make it voide? for our Antinomians ſay, that it is faith, and being in Chriſt, that freeth vs from the law: the law (ſay they) is a ſcholemaſter to bring vs vnto Chriſt, and being in Chriſt once, which is by faith, then we are no longer vnder this ſchoolmaſter of the law in any reſpect; we are freed from the law wholly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together: but the cleane contrary S.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21140:23"/>Iudicall, or Ceremoniall: if then they reiect the morall law, much more will they reiect the Iudicall and Ceremoniall lawes: and if they reiect the morall law, then will they reiect all the expoſitions and branches thereof, deliuered by the Prophets; and ſo they reiect the whole old Teſtament, the law and the Prophets: for they reiect all the three lawes, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, Iudiciall, and Ceremoniall, with all their appurtenances. 2.

                        <p>It is obiected that we are freed from the law: becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith plainly, <hi>yee are not vnder the law, but vnder grace,</hi> Rom. 6.14. And againe, <hi>If ye be led by the ſpirit, yee are not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law,</hi> Gal. 5.18.</p>
                        <p>How euer many anſwers might be giuen to theſe textes, yet I will content my ſelfe with one: <hi>ye erre (ſaid our Sauiour Chriſt) becauſe you know not the Scriptures,</hi> the ſame I might apply vnto thoſe who thus abuſe theſe Textes: did they but vnderſtand the Apoſtles ſcope, and vſe of this phraſe (to be vnder the law) they might haue ſpared vs this labour: who ſo will but obſerue the ſcope and drifte of S. Paul, ſhall eaſily find it, that he diſputed only againſt iuſtification by the law, Rom. 3.20. Rom. 9.31.32. Gal. 5.4. And that he might the better diſſwad his aduerſaries, from ſeeking iuſtification by the Law, and ſo from being vnder the lavv in that reſpect, he ſheweth the danger of being vnder the law, and ſeeking righteouſneſſe by the lavv: for, <hi>by the law (ſaith he) comes the knowledge of ſinne,</hi> Rom. 3.20. and, <hi>the law cauſeth wrath,</hi> Rom. 4.15. and, <hi>as many as are of the workes of the law, are vnder the curſe,</hi> Gal. 3.10. and this is the condition of all ſuch as will be vnder the Law, and wil be iuſtified by the Law, where as they ſeeke for iuſtification by it, they ſhal find the cleane contrary, namely wrath, the curſe, and condemnation: On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the faithfull, who ſought iuſtification by grace and by Chriſt, and renounced the law, he ſpeaketh vnto them, as vnto men ſet at liberty, ſaying, <hi>yee are not vnder the law:</hi> that is, yee beleeuers are not vnder the law now, as once yee were before yee beleeued, and as thoſe vnbeleeuing Iewes are, that is, you are not vnder the law for iuſtification, and conſequently, you are not vnder the law,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21140:25"/>as <hi>cauſing wrath,</hi> and as being <hi>vnder the carſe:</hi> thus you ſee, the Apoſtle freeth the faithfull, from being vnder the law; as thos vnbeleeuing Iewes were, that is, as touching the curſe of the law; but hers not a word of freeing the faithfull, from the obſeruation of the law, and from being vnder the law in this reſpect.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This may further appeare, by that other phraſe ioyned with it and oppoſed to it, (vnder grace) whereby is no thing elſe ſignified, but the free iuſtification of a beleeuer by the mercy of God, for the merite of Chriſt; as you may ſee, Rom. 3.24. Rom. 5.15.17.21. Rom. 6.1. Gal. 2.21. Gal. 5.4. wherfore, as this phraſe (to be vnder grace) hath reſpect only vnto iuſtification, ſo its oppoſite (not to be vnder the law) hath only reſpect vnto iuſtification; the one phraſe expreſſing hovv beleeuers are iuſtified; the other how they are not iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: beleeuers are iuſtified by the grace of God, not by the workes of the law; by being vnder grace, not by being vnder the law: as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, yee beleeuers are not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law for Iuſtification, but are vnder grace for Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. So ſtill the Apoſtle freeth not the faithfull from being vnder the Lavv, for obſeruation, but only for iuſtification.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That by this Phraſe, vnder the law, S. Paul meante a being vnder the law for iuſtification, I proue it in his Epiſtle to the Galatians; for in Gal. 4.21. he vſeth this phraſe ſaying tell mee, yee that will <hi>be vnder the law,</hi> &amp;c. The which Phraſe, him ſelfe by and by in the next chapter expoundeth, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſing, the ſame thing, in other and more perſpicuouſe words, ſaying, ye are aboliſhed from Chriſt: whoſoeuer are <hi>iuſtified by the law,</hi> Gal. 5.4. ſo then to be vnder the law, is nothing elſe then to be juſtified by the law: for the Apoſtle ſpeaketh againſt the law, in one and the ſame ſenſe, in the fourth and fifth chapters, his diſcourſe being continued as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one and the ſame matter: ſo then, this phraſe being rightly vnderſtood, it maketh againſt the vſe of the law for iuſtification, but not at all for obſeruation.</p>
                        <p>I remember I haue heard ſome of them reply againſt this diſtinction, and ſay, that the law was not made to iuſtifie
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21140:25"/>any; neither did God euer intend to iuſtify any by the law. Where to I anſwer, that God propounded the law, either for iuſtification or for condemnation, ſee Luk. 10.28.27. Gal. 3.12. Rom. 10.5. but admit that God neuer intended to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy any man by the law, yet many men there were, that ſought iuſtification by the law, ſee Mat. 19.16, 17. Rom. 9.31.32. Gal. 4.21. Gal. 5.4. And therefore, there is ground enough for vs to ſay, that S. Paul diſputed againſt the law, as vrged by ſome vnto iuſtification.</p>

                        <p>It is further obiected, the law is aboliſhed; for S. Paul ſaith of it, <hi>if that which is done away, was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious, 2 Cor. 3.11.</hi> here the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Morall Law, for he ſpeaketh of that law, which was <hi>ingrauen in ſtones,</hi> v. 7. and of this law he ſaith, that it is aboliſhed or done away.</p>
                        <p>Herevnto I anſwer. 1. That howbeit the text ſpeaketh, as if the law were quite aboliſhed in all reſpectes, yet that the Apoſtle muſt be vnderſtood here, to aboliſh the law only in ſome reſpect, and to let it ſtand ſtill in ſome other reſpect, our aduerſaries them ſelues doe and muſt hold: for they ſay, that the law is aboliſhed in deed to a beleeuer, but it ſtands ſtill to an vnbeleeuer and one vnregenerated: for the law ſerues ſtill to be a ſcholemaſter, to bring men to Chriſt, Gal. 3.24. yea, they haue no other euaſion from all our Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, whereby we proue the law to be ſtill in force, ſaue this, to anſwer that thoſe Textes were ſpoken to a mixed congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of beleeuers and vnbeleeuers, and ſo the Textes are ſay they to be vnderſtood of the vnbeleeuers: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t is plain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they vrge not this Text for the vtter aboliſhing of the law; wherefore, ſince them ſelues doe diſtinguiſh of the law, in what ſenſe it ſtands ſtill, and in what ſenſe it is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, they muſt giue vs leaue to diſtinguiſh alſo.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer then vnto this text, the law is to be conſidered, either as it (through our weakneſſe) tendeth vnto <hi>condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or as it ſheweth vs light for <hi>obſeruation:</hi> now the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the law in the former ſenſe: and that this is ſo, is

                        <p>Yet further they obiect to vs the text, Gal. 5.22.23. But the fruit of the Spirit is loue, ioy, peace, long ſuffering, gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leneſſe, goodneſſe, faith, meekneſſe, temperance, <hi>againſt ſuch there is no law:</hi> here the Apoſtle freeth the faithfull from the law.</p>
                        <p>For anſwer hereto, we muſt know that as in the poenall lawes of men there are two things, the matter of the law, and the poenalty of the law, ſo may we conſider alſo two things in Gods law, the <hi>matter,</hi> and the <hi>poenalty:</hi> if we reſpect the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the law, it is againſt all vngodlineſſe &amp; vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, and againſt all vngodly and vnrighteous men, for it forbiddeth all ſinne, and ſo is againſt all ſinners, and againſt none but ſinners: wherefore, the Apoſtle conſidering the faithfull here, as righteous men, walking in loue, peace, meekneſſe and temperance, might well ſay, there is no law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch: for the law doth not forbid ſuch things, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them rather; the law is not againſt ſuch perſones but for them rather. Now in al this, the Apoſtle doth not free theſe faithfull ones, from the obſervation of the lavv as a rule of liefe; he ſpeaketh of no ſuch matter, he ſaith only, that the lavv doth not ſet it ſelfe againſt, or forbid men loue, peace, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and temperance, &amp;c. 2. The Lavv may be taken, for the poenalty of the lavv, Ioh. 19.7. 2 Cor. 3.6.7.9. Gal. 3.10.12.21. For it threateneth death: and ſo is called <hi>a killing letter</hi> and the <hi>miniſtration of condemnation:</hi> novv in this ſenſe, as the law is conſidered in reſpect vnto the poenalty therof, ſo the faithfull are freed from the lavv indeed; and in this ſenſe there is no lavv againſt the faithfull: for, <hi>there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them which are in Chriſt Ieſus, which walke not after the

                        <p>For anſvver vnto this text, firſt me muſt knovv vvho is <hi>a righteous man</hi> in S.

Rom. <hi>5.1.</hi> ſo then, a beleeuer is accounted for a righteous man: and this righteous man is freed from condemnation by Chriſt: <hi>now then there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8.1. Theſe things premiſed, I anſvver to this text by the former diſtinction, to vvit, that by the lavv, is ſomtime meant the <hi>matter</hi> of the lavv, and ſomtime the <hi>poenalty</hi> of the law, as hath bene proued: now in this place, the Apoſtle may be vnderſtood, to ſpeake only of the lavv in reſpect of the poenaltie thereof, as it cauſeth wrath, as it is a killing letter, &amp; as it is the miniſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of condemnation; now in this ſenſe, the law is not giuen to a righteous man: for hee is freed from the poenalty and curſe of the law by Chriſt, who is <hi>made a curſe for vs,</hi> Gal. 3.13. and in this ſenſe, the lavv is giuen only to the lawleſſe and diſobedient, to the vngodly and to ſinners, to murtherers of fathers and mothers, &amp;c. as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh.</p>
                        <p>Or, if by the lavv you vvill vnderſtand the matter of the lavv, then I anſwer, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the law with reſpect vnto iuſtifiation by it, and not with reſpect of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of it: for the lavv is not giuen to a righteous man to iuſtifie him: becauſe he is iuſtified an other way, that is by faith, in Chriſt, and ſo he is become to a righteous man, not by the lavv, but by faith. Thus, this text rightly vnderſtood, it maketh nothing at all againſt a righteous mans obſeruation of the lavv: it only freeth him from condemnation by the

                        <p>I ſhall giue none other anſvver vnto this text, then vnto the former, to wit, that by the law is vnderſtood the penalty of the law, &amp; the curſe of the law; or the law in reſpect of the penalty and curſe thereof: that this is the Apoſtles meaning, I make it appeare by two reaſons from the context. 1. See v. 4. <hi>So ye my brethren, are dead to the law, by the body of Chriſt:</hi> by the body of Chriſt, that is by the ſufferings of Chriſt in his body: now if Chriſt hath freed vs from the law, by his ſuffering of death, what can this intimate, but that the law, from which he freed vs by death, was conſidered, in reſpect of the penalty and curſe, and as holding vs in bondage vnto death. For by death, Chriſt freed vs from death: wherefore, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, we are dead to the law, or freed from the lavv, he conſidered the law as a killing letter, and as it held vs in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage vnto death. 2. See v. <hi>5. When we were in the fleſh, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of ſinnes which were by the law, had force in our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to bring forth fruit vnto death:</hi> To bring forth fruit vnto death: here the Apoſtle, ſpeaketh of the law, not ſimply, but of the law, as (together with our corruption) fructifying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21140:27"/>death: wherefore, ſeeing the Apoſtle ſpake of the lavv, as tending vnto death, it follovveth, that vvhen in the very next vvords, he ſaid, <hi>We are deliuered from the law,</hi> v. 6. he meant, that vve are deliuered from the poenalty and curſe of the lavv, or from the lavv as it reſpecteth the curſe, to vvit, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death and deſtruction: ſo then, here is nothing yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, againſt the lavv, for obſeruation as a rule of liefe.</p>
                        <p>It vvas not for nothing, that S. Paul added theſe vvords <hi>for righteouſneſſe;</hi> ſaying, <hi>Chriſt is the end of the law (to wit) for righteouſneſſe</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 10.4. Shevving thereby, that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted againſt the lavv, not ſimply, but conſidered as the meanes of iuſtification and obtaining righteouſneſſe. Neither is it to be paſſed by vvithout ſpeciall obſeruation, that S. Paul diſputing in another place againſt the law, doth it not againſt the lavv ſimply, but againſt the lavv conſidered as tending to the curſe to thoſe vvho ſought righteouſneſſe thereby, and therefore he ſaid not, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed vs from the law,</hi> Gal. 3.13. but Chriſt hath redeemed vs <hi>from the curſe of the law.</hi> Yea, it is remarkable, that euery where, where S. Paul diſputeth againſt the lavv, his maine queſtion is about iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the law: denying iuſtification by the law, ſaying, <hi>By the works of the law, ſhall no fleſh be iuſtified,</hi> Rom. 3.20. Gal. 2.16. So that S. Paul diſputeth againſt the lavv, onely with reſpect had vnto obtaining righteouſneſſe and iuſtification thereby, and in reſpect of the curſe of the lavv. But it is no vvhere found, that Chriſt is the end of the lavv, for obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and for a rule of an holy liefe: nor is it any vvhere found, that Chriſt hath redeemed vs, from obſeruation of or obedience to the lavv: nor yet is it any vvhere ſaid, By the lavv, ſhall no fleſh be directed, or guided in their liues and conuerſation: vvherefore, for time to come, if Anabaptiſts and Antinomians vvill obiect againſt the law, by way of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to vs, let them not proue that the lavv is aboliſhed in reſpect of iuſtification, and as a curſe &amp;c. For all this, vve ſtedfaſtly beleeue and teach; but let them remember to proue vnto vs, that the lavv is aboliſhed as a rule of liefe, &amp; for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation; for this is that vvhich vve deny onely; that Chriſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21140:28"/>hath aboliſhed the poenalty of the lavv, vve beleeue it, but that he hath aboliſhed the matter of the law, this we deny, and this as yet they haue not proued, nor euer ſhall be able: if we will be S.

                        <p>We haue novv made anſwer vnto the moſt and chiefeſt of their Scriptures, which they alleage againſt the law, others they haue alſo, but they are ſuch as will admit of the ſame anſwere giuen to ſome of theſe, or elſe are ſo triuiall, as they deſerue no anſwer: to conclud then, ſince I haue firmely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it, that the law is ſtill in force, and that to all men, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and vnbeleeuers for obſeruation; and ſince they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer our Textes, nor yet proue the contrary, it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that the Morall law is ſtill in force; which being ſo, Gods ancient Sabbath commanded in this law is ſtill in force alſo: for both Anabaptiſtes and Antinomians haue confeſſed this vnto me, that if it can be proued, that the Morall law is ſtill in force, then it muſt and doeth vndeniably follow, that the <hi>Saturday Sabbath</hi> is ſtill in force, as well as any other thing commanded in the law.

                     <head>SECT. II.</head>
                     <p>The thing vvhich Almightie God intendeth generally in this Com. is hovv all the time and dayes of our liues, ſhould be ſpent and imployed in his ſeruice: the vvhich, is backed vvith an effectuall reaſon (for my purpoſe is firſt to handle the commandement generally, as in this ſecond Section: and then more particularly, as in the thirth Section, &amp;c.) As for the time, we haue a diſtribution of it in the comm. and that into the Sixe dayes, and into the ſeuenth day: touching both of theſe, God hath ordered it, in this comm. hovv he vvould be ſerued; to vvit, on the ſeuenth day, by Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hallovving of it, in the partes of his vvorſhip and ſeruice, and a ceſſation from all ſeruile vvorkes; on the ſixt dayes, by following ſome lavvfull calling or other, vvich may redovvnd to the glorie of God; according to that, 1 Cor. 10.31. <hi>Whither therefore, ye eate, or drinke, or whatſoeuer yee doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi> As for the reaſon, it is a liuely &amp; mouing one, it being fetched from God him ſelfe, and from his owne enſample.</p>
                     <p>In this reaſon, conteined in Exod. 20.11. vve haue alſo a diſtribution of time, in to the ſixe dayes, and into the ſeuenth day; vvherein it pleaſeth God, to declare vnto vs, hovv he ſpent and imployed his time, to vvit, the firſt vveeke, or ſeuenth dayes, that euer the vvorld ſavv or heard of: the ſixe dayes, that is thoſe ſixe dayes, vvhich for order of number, &amp; order of nature, vvent immediatly before the firſt ſeuenth day, or firſt Saturday that euer vvas; theſe God ſpent in vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and in making the heauens and the earth, and all the hoſte of them. This God hath reuealed vnto vs, vnto this end for one, that vve ſhould in imitation of him, make choyſe of thoſe ſame ſixe dayes vvherin God vvrought, that in them and none other, vve ſhould vvorke as God vvrought and in them, vve ſhould finiſh all our vvorkes, as God in them fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed all his vvorkes. The ſeuenth day, that is, the ſeuenth day from the Creation, or the firſt Saturday that euer vvas, this day God ſpent in an holy ceſſation and reſting, from the vvorkes of creation; and therefore this time, this day, aboue
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21140:29"/>and before all other times &amp; dayes, God bleſſed &amp; ſanctified: and this hath reuealed vnto vs, to this end and purpoſe, that we ſhould in an holy imitation of God, ceaſe from the workes of the ſixe dayes before, and reſt from all ſeruil labour; and that we ſhold make choiſe of this very day, to Sanctifie it and to hallow it like as God bleſſed it, and hallovved it.</p>
                     <p>Novv that we are not left to our liberty, in this imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the time and dayes of our liefe appeareth here by, firſt becauſe God hath commanded it: and ſecondly, God hath backed his commandement, by a ſtrong &amp; forcible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, dravvne from his owne enſample; that we ſhold ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the dayes of the weeke, as God him ſelfe at the Creation imployed them; and this is noted by that rationall particle (for) Exod. 20.11. And this is that which God aimeth at in this com. generally namely, that we ſhold ſpend and imploy euery day, and all the dayes of the weeke, after the enſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; or as God himſelfe ſpent them.</p>
                     <p>The thing which Almightie God intendeth in this com. ſpecially and principally, is the hallowing of that ſacred time and day, called the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> and the <hi>Seuenth day,</hi> as in the third Comm. God inioyned the hallowing of his Sacred <hi>Name,</hi> ſo in this fourth com. God inioyned the hallowing of his Sacred <hi>day,</hi> to wit, the <hi>ſeuenth day,</hi> the which him ſelfe had made holy, aboue all dayes, by his bleſſing of it, and Sanctifying of it, as we reade, Geneſ. 2.3. like as the king might ſay to his ſubiectes, Remember my Coronation day, to keepe it an holy day; or Remember the Gunpowder Treaſon day, to Keepe it an holy day; ſo ſaith the king of kings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sabbath day, to keepe it holy, Exod. 20.8.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Sanctification of this day, it is inioyned, both affirmatiuely, and negatiuely; affirmatiuely, in theſe words, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day, to Sanctifie it:</hi> Negatiuely, in theſe words, <hi>In it, thou ſholt not doe any worke:</hi> the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue parte of the precept, requireth ſanctity, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of holy duties; the Negatiue parte of the precept, requireth a reſting from laboures in our ordenary callings, which hinder and thruſt out thoſe holy duties.</p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:21140:30"/>
                     <p> Thirdly, the Lord God inioyneth vs in this comm. tvvo things; the one is the duety of the day; the other is the dueties of reſt from labours, and the perfermance of ſondry the parts of Gods worſhip and ſeruice, in the day.</p>
                     <p>I call it the duety of the day, becauſe we are no leſſe bound in duety to God, to that day, then to the dueties of reſt and holineſſe in the day; or, we are no leſſe bound, to performe the dueties of reſt and holineſſe on that day, then we are tyed to performe the dueties of reſt and holineſſe them ſelues. I cleere the point by theſe examples, as in a bond you haue two eſſentiall parts; the one, is the ſome of mony to be paied; the other is the day and time when it is to be paied; and a man is equally and alike bound to both of theſe; that is, as well to the day, as to the ſome of mony; as appeareth by this, that al though a man bring the full ſome of mony, yet if he omit the day, and come the day after, his bond is forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And as in circumciſion, there was two things inioyned, the one was the cutting off of the foreskine, the other was the time and day when it was to be done, namely vpon the 8th. day, Geneſ. 17.12. and as in that other Sacrament of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouer, there was tvvo things commanded, the one vvas the ſlaying and eating of the paſſouer lamb, the other was the time and day when to bedone, namely vpon the 14th. day of the moneth, Exod. 12.6.8. in both which Sacraments of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and paſſouer, the day &amp; time was no leſſe a duety, then were the actions to be performed in thoſe times and dayes: for it was death to omit thes dayes, Geneſ. 17.14. Numb. 9.13. Iuſt ſo, in this fourth com. God inioyneth vs expreſly two things, as eſſential parts of this comm. the one, is the duety of the day, in theſe words Remember the Sabbath day, Exod. 20.8. and, the ſeuenth day, is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, verſ. 10. the other is the dueties in the day, in theſe words, To keepe it holy, verſ. 8. and, in it thou ſhalt not doe any vvorke, verſ. 10. and here the time and day as you ſee, is no leſſe commanded, and that both affirmatiuely and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, then are the dueties in the day.</p>
                     <p>The thing vvhich Almightie God intendeth in this com.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21140:30"/>leſſe principally, is the duety of labouring ſixe dayes, ſeruing God in ſome honeſt calling; for which God hath giuen a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement alſo ſaying, <hi>Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour, and doe all thy worke.</hi> Now this commandement (as I conceiue it) is ſubordinate to the former, made for the Sanctification of the Sabbath day; and made to backe it and to ſupport it: for becauſe God wold haue his people, to Sanctify his Sabbath day, and to reſt therin from labours, that ſo a vacancy may be for holy dueties, therefore hath God added an other precept, commanding vs, to doe all the workes we haue to doe, with in the compaſſe of the ſixe dayes, that ſo no worke may be left to doe in the ſeuenth day Sabbath: So then, theſe tvvo Commandements, to wit, to Sanctify the ſeuenth day, and to labour in the Sixe dayes, may well goe in accompt but for one, and be both called the fourth Comm. becauſe they tend both to one thing, that is, to the ſanctification of the ſeuenth day Sabbath, a like caſe you haue in the 10th. command. in which are many commandements, but becauſe they agree all in this one, of coueting, therefore are they all counted but for one.</p>
                     <p>Thus much be ſpoken, touching the generall ſuruey, of the ſeuerales and particulares, conteined in the fourth com. In which paſſages, for matter of vſe, we may note firſt: what manner of computation of time God maketh, when he ſpeaketh of his Morall Sabbathes: this may eaſily be gathered out of this fourth com. for heere God diuideth all the dayes of the world into ſeauenes; or weeks; as thus, <hi>Sixe dayes</hi> thou ſhalt labour,  but <hi>the ſeuenth day,</hi> is the Sabbath: and againe, In <hi>Sixe dayes,</hi> the Lord made heauen and earth, &amp;c. and reſted <hi>the ſeuenth day,</hi> &amp;c: And this account hath bene Kept in the Church, all along from age to age, both in the times of the Old Teſtament, and of the New Teſtament; ſee Geneſ. 1.31. with Geneſ. 2.2. ſee Exod. 16.22.23.26. Exod. 20.9.10. Mark. 16.1.2. Act. 20.7. Luk. 13.14. Yet further, becauſe we are to be imitatores of God, in this poinct; it is needfull that vve diligently Marke which are thoſe dayes, the which in Gods account, doe make vp a weeke; or which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21140:31"/>of all the dayes in the yeere, are thoſe dayes, which belong vnto this or that Number of Gods ſeauen: the which if it be not well obſerued, vve may make a confuſion of the account of Gods weeks and ſeauens; and vvhereas he ſaith, ſix dayes thou ſhalt labour; if this be not obſerued, vve may ſo rekon our ſix dayes, as vve may count the day peculiarly appointed for the Sabbath day, for one of our ſixe dayes, and ſo make it a vvorking day, quit againſt the mind of God, and manie drifte and ſcope of his fourth comm. yea, if we haue no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rule, where to begine our accompt, then may we skipp ouer as many dayes as vve pleaſe, before vve begine to rekon our ſixe dayes, and ſo God ſhall haue a Sabbath or ſeuenth day, but once a moneth, or once a quarter, or once a yeere; it is very needfull therefore that we learne this point of God, to knovv vvhich day he counted for the firſt day of the weeke, and vvhich for the ſeuenth day of the vveeke, that ſo vve may knovv, which are thoſe dayes vvherein vve muſt labour; and which for certaine is that day, in which muſt reſt from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: leaſt the ignorant doe miſtak one for an other; and leaſt the Cuning Sophiſters of our times, doe bequile the ſimple.</p>
                     <p>In this point we may be inſtructed, from the reaſon in the fourth comm. Exod. 20.11. For in ſix dayes the Lord made heauen and earth &amp;c. and reſted the ſeuenth day; if now you will know which dayes in the moneth or yeere thoſe were, which here God called the ſix dayes, and the ſeuenth day; looke but into the hiſtory of the Creation of heauen and earth, whereof God ſpeaketh in this reaſon, and there you ſhall be ſatisfied, ſee Gen. 1. That day, God counted for the firſt day of the weeke, or of the ſeauen, wherein he created the light v. 4.5. and which was the firſt day that euer was; this day is our Sunday, or Lords day, and called conſtantly by all the Euangeliſts, and ſo by all Churches to this day, the firſt day of the weeke, it being the firſt day of the worlds crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſee Matt. 28.1. Mark. 16.2. Luk. 24.1. Ioh. 20.1. Act. 20.7. That day God counted for the ſecond day of the weeke, or of the ſeauen, wherein he made the firmament, v. 7.8. and this was the ſecond day that euer was, this day is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21140:31"/>our Monday: That day, God called the third day of the weeke, or of the ſeauen dayes, wherein he made the Earth to appeare, and the Seas, v. 10.13. and this vvas the third day from the Creation: and this day is our Tewſday: That day God called the fourth day of the weeke, wherein he made the Sunne, Moone and Starres, v. 16.19. and this vvas the fourth day from the creation, and this day is our Wedneſday. That day wherein God made the fiſhe in the Sea, and the foule in the ayre, he called the fifth day, v. 21.23. and that day, is our Thurſday. That day God called the ſixt day of the weeke, vvherein he made man, v. 26.31. and this was the ſixth day from the creation, and this day is our Friday. And that day God called and counted the ſeuenth day of the vveeke, wherein he reſted from the vvorks of Creation, and which he bleſſed &amp; ſanctified, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.1.2.3. &amp; this day is our ſaturday.</p>
                     <p>Forſomuh then as vve haue found out, vvhich are thoſe dayes, which in the fourth comm. God called the ſix dayes, and which day he called the ſeuenth day, it teacheth all mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres, in expounding this fourth com. to ſpeake as God ſpake; and to call &amp; count vnto the people, the dayes of the weeke, by thoſe numerall names, vvhich God hath put vpon them: and therefore they muſt call our Sunday or Lords day, the firſt day, and our Saturday, the Seuenth day. And alſo, as touching practiſe, that they exhorte and perſwade the people to be imitatours of God, labouring on the firſt ſix dayes of the worlds creation, and reſting for the Sabbath day, on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day from the creation, vvhich is Saturday; becauſe God himſelfe did ſo, <hi>for in ſix dayes the Lord made heauen and earth, and reſted the ſeuenth day,</hi> vvhich is our Saturday, Exo. 20.11. It is as you ſee, the very reaſon and preſident, vvhich God himſelfe hath ſet before our eyes; and if vve like to doe as God did, and to treade in his ſteppes, then muſt vve ſpeake as God ſpake, in our account, and doe as God did, in our practiſe; This is that which <hi>Muſculus</hi> hath, in his expoſition vpon the fourth comm. fol. 66. <hi>The imitation of the example of God</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>ſtandeth in this, that in the ſame ſix dayes, in which God wrought all his workes, we worke ours: and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21140:32"/>day, when hee reſted from his, we doe reſt alſo from our works, according to his example.</hi> It is to be noted, that hee ſaith, that our imitation of God ſtandeth in this, that we vvorke on the ſame ſix dayes, in which God vvrought: and that we Reſt, on the ſame ſeuenth day, in vvhich God himſelfe reſted. This is the true expoſition of this fourth comm.</p>
                     <p>Here then is diſcouered the errour of many, vvho thus pleade for themſelues; Doe not vve according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, vvorke ſix dayes, &amp; reſt the ſeuenth day? this is a trueth they ſay indeed, but it is not Gods trueth, they labour ſix dayes indeed, but they labour not on thoſe ſame ſix dayes, which God ſpake of, and which God ſet them a ſample of in his ovvne perſon: nay they profanely labour vpon that day for one, vvhich God ſet them a patterne to reſt on, and that is vpon the Saturday. Tis true as they ſay alſo, they reſt the ſeuenth day, but not on that ſeuenth day, vvhich God coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the ſeuenth day; but on that ſeuenth day, vvhich God euer counted for the firſt day of the weeke, vvhich is our Sunday. Novv no maruaile God ſet himſelfe out for our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, that vve ſhold imitate him; ſee hovv nere vve follovv him; on our Saturday God reſted from vvorke, and ſanctified it, and vve in imitation of him, vvorke on that day, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane it: againe, on our Sunday, God vvrought, as vpon the firſt of his ſix working dayes; and vve in imitation of God, doe ceaſe from vvorke, and ſanctify it: thus vvhen God reſt, vve vvorke; and vvhen hee vvorketh, then vve reſt: is this to imitate God? or can vve oppoſe, and thvvart him more? and yet theſe men vvold thinke vve doe them vvrong, to ſay they doe not imitate God, but rather mocke God; pretending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to imitate him, according to his fourth comm. vvhen in very trueth, vve cold not deuiſe on the ſuddaine, hovv to thvvart and croſſe Gods example more then vve doe.</p>
                     <p>Now vvhence comes this erronious practiſe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but from the erronious doctrine of ſome Miniſters, vvho beſides other errours, touching the Sabbath, doe falſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the fourth command. to the people, by nicknaming of dayes, as if the ſix dayes mentioned in the Comm. might be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21140:32"/>vnderſtood of other ſix dayes, then God euer ſpake of, or vvrought in; or then the Church for thouſands of yeeres vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the fourth comm. to ſpeake of; and as if the ſeuenth day, might be attributed to ſome other day, then the ſeuenth day from the creation, vvherein God reſted: and for this purpoſe they haue inuented a diſtinction of <hi>a</hi> ſeuenth day, and <hi>the</hi> ſeuenth day, making the ignorant people beleeue, that the fourth com. ſpeaketh not of <hi>the</hi> ſeuenth day, but of <hi>a</hi> ſeuenth day, that is of any day of the ſeuen: whereby God is plainly defeated of his purpoſe: which vvas to haue that one ſeuenth day, ſanctified, vvhich he had therefore bleſſed and ſanctified; and which himſelfe reſted on, and left vs for a patterne; and hereby an other day is foiſted in, and intruded into its roome. This idle diſtinction, giues vs to learne novv, that there is <hi>a</hi> firſt day of the vveeke, and <hi>the</hi> firſt day of the vveeke: that there is <hi>a</hi> Lords day, and <hi>the</hi> Lords day: and that there might haue beene in the Church of the Iewes, had they beene ſo skillfull as vve are become, <hi>a</hi> eigth day, for circumciſion, and <hi>the</hi> eigth day: and <hi>a</hi> fourteenth day of the moneth for the paſſouer, and <hi>the</hi> fourteenth day: and theſe vnderſtood, not of one and the ſame day, but of diuers dayes: and vvhy not all theſe as vvell as <hi>a</hi> ſeuenth day &amp; <hi>the</hi> ſeuenth day? and if they pleaſe too, vve may haue <hi>a</hi> Chriſt, and <hi>the</hi> Chriſt: <hi>a</hi> Mathevv, and <hi>the</hi> Mathevv: <hi>a</hi> Iohn, and <hi>the</hi> Iohn: <hi>a</hi> Paul, and <hi>the</hi> Paul: and ſometimes theſe ſhall be expounded in one of theſe ſenſes, and aftervvard, at an other time, in the other of theſe ſenſes. Diſtinctions they be, more fit for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then for men of yeeres; for Ieſuites, then Proteſtants; for Iuglers, then honeſt meaning men.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond thing out of our generall ſuruey of the partes of this com. is that vve haue proued, that the time and day, ſpecified in the fourth com. is no leſſe commanded by God, then the dueties of reſt and holineſſe: which being ſo, here cometh to be reproued an other errour of our Miniſters: they vſe to Anſwer it thus, vvhen the duety of the very day and time is vrged vpon them: oh ſay they, the time, thats but an adiunct, but an accident, but a circumſtance; and tis not the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21140:33"/>circumſtance ſo much vvhich God lookes at, but it is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which God regardeth: novv ſee, hovv theſe men haue learned an arte to extenuate Gods commandements, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them lightly and regardleſly, but an accident, but a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance: who could thinke that Miniſters, yea Puritane Miniſters, vvho ſhold back Gods commandements, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence the things commanded, ſhold <hi>but</hi> at them; and as it were puſh at them vvith a <hi>but,</hi> ſaying tis <hi>but</hi> a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, &amp;c? is not this a contempt offered to the Holy one of Iſrael, thus to ſleight him in his ordinance? durſt euer the Church of the Ievves, thus <hi>but</hi> at the eigth day, appointed of God for circumciſion, ſaying the ſtrict day is <hi>but</hi> time, <hi>but</hi> a circumſtance, what if we neglect it, and circumciſe on the nineth day, the day after? it is the Subſtance, of cutting off the foreskine, which God lookes at: &amp; might they then haue thus ſleighted the time ordeined of God for the paſſouer, to be eaten on the 14th. day of the moneth, by ſaying the preciſe time, was <hi>but</hi> a circumſtance, and ſo be we eate the paſſouer, it matters not, if we eate it on the 15th. or 16th. day of the moneth? were any of vs, bound in a bond, to paie vnto his Maieſtie, a certaine ſome of mony, vpon the ſeuenth day of May, durſt we aduenture it, to ſleyght the preciſe day of payment, vpon this idle pretenſe, that the day and time in the bond, it is <hi>but</hi> an adiunct, <hi>but</hi> a circumſtance: all will be well enough therefore if I tender the ſome of mony vpon the eigth day or ninth day of May? vvere this but a common bond betwixt ſubiect and ſubiect: ſure I am no Lawyer, no Iudge, no nor any common man. but vvold ſay this were a plaine forfeiture of the bond; and that the debitor his calling the time but a circumſtance, vvas but a pore ſhifte; this vvere a ſilly plea before the Iudg of Aſſiſes, to ſay the time my Lord, it was but a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, &amp;c. well hovv euer men dare not dally thus before an earthly Iudge and with an earthly king, yet men dare palter thus with the king of kings: were a man ſummoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at a day apponinted, but in an inferiour courte, who durſt ſleight that day? They are only Gods dayes, and Gods
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21140:33"/>times then, that may beſleighted: this bewraies that God is not reuerenced as is a mortall king or Iudg, men dare not ſleight the preciſe day of appearance in the Courtes of men; but men dare ſleight the preciſe day of appearance before the Lord chiefe Iuſtice of heauen &amp; earth, in the Courtes of his fanctuary: nor are men ſo afraid to make a forfeiture of the bond of Gods fourth comm. by neglect of the day, as they are a fraid to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feite abond of 10. or 20. to a man by neglect of the day. Thus much for the time and day, in generall, we ſhall hereafter come to the particularity of the time, to ſhew how more ſpecially what day it is which God requireth.</p>

                     <p>For the word Day, to giue an Expoſition of it according to the minde of the holy ghoſt, we muſt ſerch how the holy Ghoſt vſeth this vvord in Scripture: for this purpoſe ſee Geneſ. 1.5. <hi>And God called the light, day,</hi> but no where hath he called the darkneſſe day; wherefore the light only is the day, in Gods accounte: ſee alſo 1 Cor. 3.13. euery mans worke ſhal be made manifeſt, <hi>for the day ſhall declare it.</hi> Where, by the word Day, the holy Ghoſt meaneth the light: ſee 1 Theſ. 5.8. <hi>But let vs who are of the day be ſober.</hi> Where by day, is meant light, as appeareth by the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of, the word night, in the former verſe: ſe Joh. 11.9. <hi>are there not</hi> 12 <hi>howres in the day, if any man walke in the day, he ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth not, becauſe he ſeeth the light:</hi> the day therefore is the time of light, by Scriptures accompt: wherefore by the word day; in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21140:34"/>fourth Com. I vnderſtand the time of light, and of light only.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond querie may be to know, how long this day is, and when it beginneth, and when it endeth. For the beginning of it, we are to giue it the largeſt extent, as to begin early in the morning by day breake, or day peepe, euen whilſt it is but a little light, and much darkneſſe, ſee Ioh. 20.1. and Mark. 1.35. this laſt text is to be reade as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> well obſerues thus; In the morning, whilſt it was very much night, &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and ſo <hi>Beza</hi> readeth it alſo. Now as the day beginneth, with the leaſt light appearing in the skie, ſo we are to thinke, it laſteth ſo long, as there is any ſunne light in the skie, or vntill the day be quite off the skie: thus much be ſpoken of the word day ſhewing 1. what is meant by it, to wit, the time of light. 2. How long this day is, to wit, from the firſt approch of the ſunne light, vnto the laſt departure of its light.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of theſe twoo Points diſcouereth vnto vs a threefold errour of our times; the one is of ſuch as hould that the Sabbath day, beginneth at midnight, and laſteth to the next midnight: the other, is of thoſe who hould the Sabbath day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth in the morning, &amp; laſteth to the next morning: the other, of ſuch as hould it beginneth on the Euening of Saturday night: al which opinions in they hould as well a night, as a day, to be a parte of the ſabbath day: but theſe are all erroniouſe, becauſe growndleſſe; for the word day, in the com. ſignifieth the time of light, &amp; this is the frequent vſe of the word in ſcriptures; &amp; that the word day, muſt ſignify darkneſſe; as wel as light, I thinke cannot be ſhowne in the Scriptures. Wherefore, as to giue God leſſe then the wholl tyme of light, is to giue God not a day, but a peece of a day, ſo to giue God more then the wholl time of light, it to giue God more then a wholl day, and ſo more then God hath commanded.</p>
                     <p>But againſt this it may be ſaid, that there it a day naturall, &amp; a day artificiall, the one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting of 24 howres, the other of 12 howres, now we muſt giue God the largeſt day, of 24. hovvres: But for this pointe, how euer this diſtinction may haue its vſe in ciuill affaires, yet is it not founded in Scripture: the Scriptures indeed mention a day of 12. howres, Ioh. 11.9. but of a day of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21140:34"/>24. hovvres, I no where reade: it is not ſafe therefore, to expound the word day, in the fourth Comm. of a day of 24: hovvres.</p>
                     <p>Further it may be ſaid, that by the word day, we muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the night and darkneſſe alſo, euen the wholl time of 24. howres: for ſo it is taken, Geneſ. <hi>1.5. And the euening and morning were the firſt day:</hi> where the euening is put for the darkneſſe; and the morning is put for the light, and both theſe are called the firſt day. Where to I anſwer, that this expoſition is growndleſſe, to ſay that the Euening is put for the night or darkneſſe; for it cannot be ſhovvne in Scripture, that any where the word Euening, is put for the night or darkneſſe: Herevnto aſſenteth <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Perkins</hi> in his caſes of conſcience, at the end of the ſecond booke. Secondly I anſwer, to giue ſuch an expoſition of the Text, Geneſ. 1.5. as maketh a confuſion of things, is not ſafe, for to vnderſtand by the Euening the darkneſſe, and ſo making the vvord day, to ſignify or comprize both light and darkneſſe is to make a vvofull confuſion; for ſo one and the ſame vvord ſhall ſignifie things quite contrary; as vvel might one ſuppoſe hell to be ſignified vnder the vvord heauen, as night vnder the vvord day: God hath diſtinguiſhed the light from the darkneſſe as in nature, ſo by ſondry proper names, calling the light day, and the darkneſſe he called night, Geneſ. 1.5. let not vs then confound them: a better expoſition of the vvord Euening, is therefore to be ſought; for this end it is to be noted, that the vvord Euening in Scripture, is vſed for the after-noone, and ſo vntill day light befully ended, according to our Engeliſh ſpeech, ſaying, good Euen to you Sir, when tis paſt noone; and calling them Euening prayers vſed in the Church about 2. or 3. a clocke in the after-noone; and ſo theire Euening Sacrifice in the Temple, in the after-noone; and in this ſenſe ſee thes Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Geneſ. 24.11. Mark. 15.42. Exod. 29.38.39. Deut. 23.11. Ioſh. 8.29. Ezra. 9.4.5. Ierem. 6.4. Deut. 16.6. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to the conſtant vſe of the vvord Euening, both amongſt vs to this day, and alſo in the Scriptures, I wold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the word of the after-noone; and ſo vvhereas it is ſaid, the Euening and the morning made the firſt day, that is,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21140:35"/>the after-noone and the forenoone made the firſt day; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by morning the fore noone, as by euening the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone.</p>
                     <p>I knovv nothing againſt this interpretation, vnleſſe it be, that ſome may obiect and ſay, this is to make God put dovvne things miſorderly; for it had bene better to haue ſaid, ſo the forenoone and the afternoone made the firſt day, rather then, ſo the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone and the forenoone made the firſt day. Whereto I anſwer, 1. The darkeneſſe was for order before the light, and yet God put the light before the darkneſſe, in this very fifth verſe, <hi>and God called the light day, and the darkneſſe, he called night:</hi> and why might he not alſo put the afternoone before the forenoone? 2. Why might not God ſet the afternoone, which is the latter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the forenoone, which is the former, as well as Chriſt our Sauiour ſetteth forth the Lord of the vineyard, commanding his ſteward, to call the labourers, and giue them their hier, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> from the <hi>laſt</hi> vnto the <hi>firſt,</hi> Matt. 20.8? and thus much touching the two formoſt erroures, holding the Sabbath day to beginne at midnight, and in the morning, ſo as they will haue a night, added to the day, or light.</p>
                     <p>Now, touching the third errour of thoſe who would haue the Sabhath day, to begin on the Euening before the day, and ſo to conteine all that night that goeth before the day; &amp; theſe ſeeme to haue many Scriptures to backe them, as firſt Leuit. 23.32 <hi>from Euen to Euen, ſhall ye celebrate your Sabbath.</hi> Herevnto I anſwer, this is a peculiar law, for one of the annuall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Sabbaths; and it therefore concerneth not the weekly morall Sabbath in the fourth comm. now we muſt not draw the law of this ceremoniall Sabbath, vpon the morall Sabbath: for then 1. muſt the morall Sabbath be annuall only. 2. It muſt be vpon the teenth day of the moneth, without regard had to the day of the vveeke; for ſo it was with this ceremoniall Sabbath. 3 It muſt laſt one wholl day, and a parte of the day before it alſo, for ſo it vvas vvith that ceremoniall Sabbath, it vvas to hold vpon the teenth day, and vpon a parte of the nineth day alſo Leuit. 23.27.32.</p>
                     <p>An other text they produce out of Nehem. 13.19. <hi>And it came
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21140:35"/>to paſſe, that when the gates of Jeruſalem began to be darke before the Sabbath, I commanded that the gates ſhould be ſhut, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that they ſhould not be opened, till after the Sabbath</hi> &amp;c. Here ſay they Nehemiah tooke order for the Sabbath to begin, vvhen the gates of Ieruſalem began to be darke, and this is on the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Whereto I anſwer, it follovveth not that becauſe the gates vvere commanded to be ſhut, vvhen it began to be darke, that this vvas done, leaſt that euening ſhould be profaned by buying and ſelling; for it may be very likely, that ſuch as came into the citty with their packes of wares, and pedds of fiſh, (as v. 16.) ſo late in the euening, vvhen it vvas almoſt darke, vvould not open their packes that night, nor goe into the fiſh ſtales in the market place, at that time of the day, but rather Nehemiah foreſeeing, that if he permitted them to come into the citty laden, ſo late in the euening, that they minded to be at their marketing early the next morning; vvherefore to preuent that, he ſhut them out of the citty ouer night, but not becauſe the Sabbath began ouer night, in the euening. 2. I anſvver, if the Sabbath day began in the euening, at vvhat time <hi>Nehemiah</hi> cauſed the gates to be ſhut in, then theſe abſurdeties vvill follovv, <hi>1.</hi> that they began the Sabbath, before it vvas Sabbath; and they kept the Sabbath, till after it vvas Sabbath; for ſo ſaith the text, that the gates vvere ſhut in <hi>before the Sabbath,</hi> and that they vvere not opened againe, till <hi>after the Sabbath.</hi> 2. If the ſhutting in of the gates, doe declare vnto vs the beginning of the Sabbath, ſo muſt it declare vnto vs by like reaſon, the end of the Sabbath: &amp; then this abſurdety follovveth, that vve muſt keepe one day, and tvvo nights, for our Sabbath; for ſo long vvere their gates ſhut in: for if they ſhut the gates in, on fry day tovvards night, they opened them not againe, on Saturday, the Sabbath day, tovvards night, nor in all likely hoode, vntill our Sunday morning; ſo their gates remained ſhut one day and tvvo nights.</p>
                     <p>A third text they produce, is Mark. 15.42. <hi>And now when the euen was come, becauſe it was the preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath:</hi> Hence they collect that the Sabbath began in the euening, and that then vvas the preparation of the Sabbath: for anſvver hereto, vve muſt knovv, that on Saturday the Sabbath
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21140:36"/>day, vvherein Chriſt lay in the graue, there vvas tvvo Sabbaths mett together vpon that one day, to vvit, the morall Saturday and vveekly Sabbath day, and alſo an annuall ceremoniall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, as <hi>Beza, Piſcator</hi> and others affirme; this ceremoniall Sabbath day, it vvas the 15th day of the moneth, the day after the Paſſouer, and by the lavv it vvas a Sabbath day: for on it, they had an holy conuocation and aſſembly, vvherein they did no ſeruill vvorke, Leuit. 23.6.7. Novv the Ievves keeping their Paſſeouer on good fryday, it vvas the 14th day of the moneth and conſequently Saturday, vvherein Chriſt lay in the graue, muſt be the 15th day of the moneth, and ſo it vvas this annuall ceremoniall Sabbath day: Novv then here being tvvo Sabbaths on this one day, to vvit, the morall Sabbath, and a ceremoniall Sabbath, hence it is, that the text may be vnderſtood of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Sabbath, not of the morall Sabbath; and ſo the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſpoken of on the euening before, may concerne the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Sabbath, which vvas called the firſt day of vnleauened bread: and indeed vve reade of a preparation, that was euer vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the day before this ceremoniall Sabbath, and it was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ready of a lamb, it muſt be ſlaine, and dreſſed, and roſted, before it could be eaten, and a conuenient place muſt be proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it to be eaten in, Exod. 12.6.8. Luk. 22.8.9.11. yea, that this preparation, had reſpect of the two Sabbaths, only vnto the ceremoniall Sabbath, is plaine, in that it is called the <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Paſseouer,</hi> Ioan. 19.14. rather then the preparation of the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> ſo this text it concerneth neither the morall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, nor any morall preparation.</p>
                     <p>By the way, the cleering of this text Mark. 15.44. wherein is mention of <hi>a preparation before the Sabbath:</hi> may be vſefull vnto vs, to diſcouer their errour, who vrge a preparation on the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing before the Sabbath, from this or the like textes; as if the Church vvere bound on the euening before the Sabbath day, to make a preparation, as they call it, and to refraine all ſeruill la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and begin then the ſanctification of the Sabbath in holy exerciſes; but this is groundleſſe. 1. For albeit vve read of a preparation to the ceremoniall Sabbath, which ſtood as hath bene ſhowne, in dreſſing of the lamb for the Paſſeouer &amp;c. yet
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21140:36"/>vve reade not of any preparation to the morall Sabbath enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or vſed: they erre therefore vvho vvould from this, and the like textes collect any ſuch preparation for the Sabbath, as to begin it on Saturday at euen: all the preparation, which God requireth for the morall Sabbath, is no more but this, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it before it cometh, and that ſo, as all our ſeruill vvorkes may be compaſſed and finiſhed by the end of the ſixth day, that ſo nothing may hinder vs from Sanctification of the ſeuenth day, vvhen it commeth.</p>
                     <p>Yet further I anſwere to the text Mark. 15.42. ſuppoſe vve that by Sabbath there mentioned, be vnderſtood the morall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, why then by preparation there ſpoken of, may nothing elſe be vnderſtood, but a preparation by finiſhing of the vvorkes of the ſixth day in the ſixth day, that ſo no vvorke be left for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day; and for this the context giueth ſome light, by the example of Ioſeph of Arimathea, v. 43. vvho vpon the ſixth day, at euen, bought fine linnen, and tooke Chriſt from the croſſe, and embalmed him vvith ſpices, and wrapped him in linnen clothes, and laid him into the ſepulchre, and finally rouled a ſtone vpon the ſepulchre, v. 46. Ioh. 19.40. all theſe vvorkes Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph fin ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d on the ſixth day, and ſo prepared himſelfe for the ſeuenth day, the Sabbath day. So in vvhich ſenſe ſoeuer you take it, heres no place for any ſuch preparation as they vrge. Yet further, this is to be noted, that it is one thing to make a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the Sabbath, and an other to begin the Sabbath: this difference they note not vvho vrge the Sabbath to begin on the euening before the Sabbath day: for, vve may make prouiſion and preparation on the day before the Sabbath, for the Sabbath, by haſting on, and contriuing of our vvorks ſo the day before, as no worke may be left to be done on the Sabbath day, and yet not begin the Sabbath vntill the next morning.</p>
                     <p>Thus we haue done with the confutation of thoſe 3 errours, which vrge from the fourth com. more then a day for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; as either all the night foregoing the Sabbath day; or all the night coming after the Sabbath day; or elſe halfe of the night foregoing the Sabbath day, and halfe of the night following the Sabbath day.</p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:21140:37"/>
                     <p> Before we can conclud this pointe, a caſe of conſcience wold be ſcanned, tis this, if it be ſo (may ſome ſay) that the Sabbath day is but the time of light only, vvhat ſhall become of the night then, or of that parte of the night, to vvit, an hovvre, two, or three before day in the depht of winter, in caſe a man riſe ſo ſoone? and of that parte of the night, to vvit, tvvo, or three howres after candles lighted; may men ſafely employ theſe times, in the ordenary workes of their callings? Where vnto I anſwer, in ſuch a caſe as this, wherin God hath left no expreſſe order, Chriſtian prudency and diſcretion muſt determine the matter; as then in the longeſt dayes of ſommer, we giue God no more of the time of light, then we can well refraine from reſt and ſleepe, ſo in the ſhorteſt dayes of winter, we ſhould in reaſon and equity, as it were by vvay of requitall, giue God all that time, of the night or darkneſſe, the which we can well ſpare from reſt and ſleepe: for in the longeſt dayes, we ſleepe 2, 3 or 4. howres after day light, and againe goe to reſt one or two howres before day light bedone. 2. It is fit we ſhould deale by God in his Sabbath dayes, as we deale by our ſelues, on the ſix working dayes; if in any of theſe we be diſpoſed to riſe before day light, or to ſet vp after day be done, we ſpend thoſe times, in actiones or workes of the ſame for kind, which we doe in the day which belongeth vnto thoſe times, to wit, in common la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures: and ſo let vs deale by God in his Sabbaths, if vve riſe before day, and ſet vp after day, let thoſe times be ſpent in workes ſutable to the day, to wit, in holy exerciſes.</p>
                     <p>But more ſpecially, for the time in the morning, before it be day, ſince that we muſt ſerue God, with all our heart, and with all our ſtrength, in the dueties of his worſhip and ſeruice on the Sabbath day, it vndeniably follovveth, that a man may not fall to the laboures of his calling, 2. or 3. hovvres before the Sabbath doth beginne; for ſo the ſtrength of his body is vveakened, and the liulineſſe and freſh cheerfulneſſe of his minde is abated and dulled, and the edge of his affections is before hand taken off and blunted: and it cannot be doubted, buth that God vvold be ſerued in his Sabbathes, with as much liulineſſe and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, and ſtrength of body and minde as may or can be: the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21140:37"/>vvhich cannot be, if a man ſpend vp and waſt his ſtrength and vigour, before hand by labors: Wherefore let vs with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid,</hi> when vvaking or vp before day, ſeeke God by prayer, and the like: <hi>I preuented</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the dawning of the morning, and cried: J hoped in thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119.147. It is then, a fit time, for a Chriſtian to exerciſe his faith, and hope in God, and to pray vnto him, namely, in the morning erly.</p>
                     <p>And for the time in the Euening, or after the euening, after the day, beſides what hath bene ſaid before in generall, this alſo maybe added in ſpeciall, that ſince there is a time for medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon the vvord of God, Pſal. 119.15. <hi>I will meditate in thy preceptes.</hi> Pſal. 119.55. <hi>I haue remembred thy name, O Lord, in the night.</hi> Pſal. 119.148. <hi>Mine eyes preuent the night watches: that I might meditate in thy word.</hi> And Pſal. 42.8. the Lord will grant his louing kindneſſe in the day, <hi>and in the night will I ſing of him &amp;c.</hi> Since I ſay there is a time for meditation of Gods word, and for ſinging of Pſalmes in priuate, what time can be more fit, then that time of the night, which immediatly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hearing of Gods word in publike? for then things are freſh in memory: we are to <hi>proue and try all things,</hi> which we heare, 1.

                     <p> It is true, vvhen Diuines in expounding theſe vvords, haue gone thus farre, namely to haue ſhowne that the word Sabbath ſignifieth a Reſt; here they leaue the point, vvithout any further ſerch, to knovv vvhich is the Sabbath day, or Reſt day, leaſt they ſhould find it: but vve not being afraid to find it, but deſirous to find it, vvill proceed further: As vvhen God commanded vs, ſaying, Honour the <hi>King,</hi> 1. Pet. 2.17. Remember yee the <hi>law</hi> of Moſes &amp;c. Mal. <hi>4.4.</hi> And, Moſes ſaid vnto the people, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this <hi>day,</hi> in vvhich yee came out of Egypt, Exod. 13.3. It is not here enough, to enquire vvhat the vvord <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Day,</hi> ſignifieth; but a further ſerch ought to be made alſo, and that is to knovv vvho, and vvhich is the King, that vve may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him: and to knovv vvhat, and vvhich is the lavv of Moſes, that vve may obey it: and thoſe Iſraelites, to knovv vvhich was the day, in which they came out of Egypt, that they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it: Euen ſo, it is not enough, to enquire vvhat the vvord Sabbath ſignifieth, but alſo vvhich is the day, that vve might ſanctify it: the which, vnleſſe we be acquainted vvith it, vve ſhall be ignorant of the very ſubiect of the Com. The name Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, it ſignifieth a Sauiour; but if novv in the expounding of Scripture, vvhen vve meete vvith the vvord Ieſus, vve haue reſpect onely vnto the ſignification of the vvord, neuer enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring further vnto the perſon, to knovv vvhich Ieſus the text ſpeaketh of, may vve not commit a foule miſtake, taking a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon man, for Chriſt Ieſus, our Sauiour? For there is in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a Ieſus, vvhich is Ioſhuah, vvho brought the Iſraelites into Canaan, Act. 7.45. Heb. 4.8. And there is a Ieſus, vvho is called Iuſtus, Col. 4.11. As it is needfull then, after vve haue ſought out the ſignification of the name Ieſus, in the next place, to ſerch to knovv vvhich Ieſus? ſo is it vvith the vvord Sabbath day, vve muſt ſerch vvhich day?</p>
                     <p>To this query then, which day of all the weeke, or of al the ſeauen dayes, is the Sabbath day? I anſwer, it may be knowne 1. by this name of it, which God hath impoſed, <hi>Sabbath day:</hi> for the name of a thing, doth giue light to the thing named; and by mens names, theire perſones are found ont. As <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> are proper names to two of Chriſts Apoſtles, ſo <hi>Sabbath day,</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:21140:39"/>is a proper name, to one certaine day of the vveeke, to vvit, to Saturday, the ſeuenth and laſt day of the weeke, that thes words Sabbath day, are a proper name for Saturday, I thus proue it, 1. becauſe none other day of the vveeke, was conſtantly called by the name Sabbath day, but the ſeuenth or laſt day of the wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, which is Saturday: ſee for this purpoſe thes Scriptures, Exod. 16.22.23.26. Exod. 20.9.10. Exod. 23.12. Exod. 35.2. Leuit. 23.3. Mat. 28.1. Luk. 13.14. I proue it ſecondly, by the teſtimony of all Iewes, novv liuing, at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> or elſe vvhere, who call Saturday, the Sabbath day: where vnto I may add, the Iewes rekoning of theire dayes of the vveeke; Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, they called Sabbath day: Sunday, they called, the firſt of the Sabbath, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Ioh. 20.1. monday, they called the ſecond of the Sabbath: Tevvſday, the third of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, &amp;c. In vvhich theire accompt, as you ſee, no day was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sabbath day, but Saturday. 3. I proue it by the teſtimony of the Lattines, vvho to this very day call our Saturday, the Sabbath day, <hi>Sabbathum</hi> and <hi>dies Sabbathi:</hi> ſe the vvord <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thum</hi> ſo tranſlated in all Lattine Dictionaries; ſinally I appeale to all Diuines, if the vvord <hi>Sabbathum</hi> be not vſed in all aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hiſtories of the Church for Saturday, the 7th. day. Thus it is euident, that Sabbath day, is a proper name, ſignifying our Saturday: and Saturday then, is the day, vvhich God meant, and ſpake of in thoſe vvords, Remember the Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, vve may knovv that Saturday, is the day vvhich God meant, by theſe vvords, Sabbath day, becauſe God hath in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>: com. plainly deciphred out the day, vvhich he called Sabbath day, and that in theſe vvordes, <hi>But the 7th. day, is the Sabbath,</hi> &amp;c. And ſee Exod. 35.2. and Exod. 23.12. Leu. 23.3. ſo then, the 7th day of the vveeke, is the very day, vvhich God vnderſtandeth by Sabbath day; novv the 7th day of the vveeke, is our ſaturday: for our Lords day, or Sonday, is called by all the 4 Euangeliſts, the firſt day of the vveeke Mat. 28.1. Mark. 16.2. Luk. 24.1. Ioh. 20.1. vvel then, rekon on, and Saturday after vvill be your 7th. day. Furthermore, it is not obſcurly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, in the reaſon to the 4th. com. Exod. 20.11. Where Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21140:39"/>God ſetteth out his ovvne enſample for vs to imitate; &amp; hee Reſted on the ſeuenth day, and hee bleſſed and Sanctified the ſeuenth day for Sabbath; vuhich ſeuenth day, from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, is our Saturday. Finally, the Sabbath day, and the 7th day, are vſed in the 4th com. promiſcuouſly the one for the other: for tis ſaid, Ex. 20.11. that God <hi>reſted the 7th day, wherefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day,</hi> &amp;c. where he ſhould haue ſaid, thus <hi>Wherefore, the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day,</hi> &amp;c. vnleſſe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and the ſeuenth day, be both one and the ſame, and here I might ad the Teſtimony of <hi>Walaeus</hi> de Sabbatho pag. 61. who affitmeth, and alſo proueth it that the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the 4th. com. is not vſed indefinitly and indeterminatly, but for the ſeuenth day from the Creation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly that our Saturday, was the Sabbath day, which vvas once commanded to the Iewes, by the 4th com. I proue by the Teſtimony of all Diuines; for doe not all, both Proteſtants and Papiſts, acknowledg that our Sauiour was crucified on Good Friday, and that hee lay in his graue, al our ſaturday, being the Iewes Sabbath day, and roſe on our Sunday? wherby they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that our Saturday, was the Sabbath day: Further more, doe not all Diuines affirme, that Saturday, the old Sabbath day, was aboliſhed by Chriſt, &amp;c? In which words they confeſſe, that Saturday, was the Sabbath day mentioned in the 4th com. what neede of further proofes?</p>
                     <p>Hauing found out particularly, which is the day of the weeke, to which the 4th com. had reſpect, namely Saturday: Now we may be bould to make a more particular deſcription of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day and thus it may be deſribed; <hi>The Sabbath day, is that ſacred time, called Saturday, counted the ſeuenth day from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which was ſanctified and hollowed by God, and appointed to be Sanctiſied by man.</hi> I call it, a ſacred time, and that in a double reſpect, 1. by <hi>deſtination:</hi> 2. By <hi>conſecration:</hi> the Sabbath day is holy by deſtination, it being ſet a parte for holineſſe, and for the worſhip of God to be celebrated in it, like as the <hi>Temple</hi> once was: Remember the Sabbath day, to <hi>Sanctifie</hi> it, Exod. 20.8. The Sabbath day is Holy by conſecration, becauſe at the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion God conſecrated it and made it an Holy day: and this he
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21140:40"/>did two waies: 1. By his perſonall and exemplary <hi>Reſt</hi> vpon this day: <hi>And the 7th. day hee reſted from all his worke, which he had made,</hi> Geneſ. 2.2. For if the grovvnd whereon Moſes ſtood became holy grownd, becauſe of Gods preſence there, Exod. 3.5. what ſhold hinder it, but that in like ſorte, the day wherin God him ſelfe reſted, ſhold forthwith become an Holy day? 2. By his hallowing and ſanctifying of this day: <hi>So God bleſſed the 7th. day and ſanctified it,</hi> &amp;c. Geneſ. 2.3. other Sabbathes were holy but by deſtination only, but ſaturday Sabbath was holy, both by deſtination and by conſecration alſo.</p>
                     <p>Hauing finiſhed this point it remaineth that we make ſome vſe and application of it; the firſt vſe then ſhall be for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and thus I reaſon, if Saturday be the day and time, which God aimed at in his 4th. com. by thoſe words Sabbath day, then may our Tranſlatores, in tranſlating of the 4th. com. ſafly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it Saturday: for Sabbath day, they may put Saturday, ſaying, <hi>Remember Saturday, to Sanctify it.</hi> For Saturday is that day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly meant by the words Sabbath day; neither haue we any day of the weeke, which will anſwer to the Sabbath day, but our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday only: and if it be objected, that the name Saturday, doth not fully expreſſe the name Sabbath day, becauſe Sabbath ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a Reſt: I anſwer, it is no more then but this, that to the name Saturday, vve add the word Reſt, and ſo we ſhall haue the full ſenſe, thus, Saturday-Reſt; <hi>Remember the Saturday-Reſt, to ſanctifie it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is obiected againſt this, that ſo doing, we ſhold bring an heatheniſh name, as Saturday is, into the Scriptures, &amp;c. Hereto I anſwer, I truſt that as our holy vſe of our Temples and Churches, hath purged that abuſe of them, vnto which many of them were firſt erected; ſo our Chriſtiaen vſe of the name Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, may ſanctifie and purge it, from heatheniſh abuſe: 2. We vſe the name but for diſtinction ſake onely, voide of all heatheniſh vanities: now why may not the name Saturday, be brought into the ſcripture of the 10 commandements, as well as that heatheniſh name <hi>Mars</hi> into the ſcripture of the Actes of the Apoſtles? <hi>Then Paul ſtood in the midſt of Mars hill, and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:21140:40"/>
                     <p> But I meane not to contend for this, I leaue it vnto the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diſcretion, of our lerned Tranſlatores, all that I aime at hereby, is only this, that I deſire all meanes and helpes may be afforded, whereby the true and proper ſenſe of the ſcriptures, may be eaſily vnderſtood, and that in as much as may be, by the ignorant and vnlearned: This one ſore euill I find, that whilſt we retaine the word Sabbath in the Com. it being an Hebrevv vvord, it is in our Church, as it vvas in thoſe dayes, vvhere in the ſcriptures, vvere in Lattine; becauſe the people vnderſtood not the Lattine toung, the prieſts might make vvhat Expoſitions they would; and ſo it is here, becauſe the vvord Sabbath, an Hebrevv vvord, is not tranſlated into Engliſh, but redd in our Bibles and retained ſtill; our Miniſters, many of them, giue what fained and fabulouſe Expoſitions of the vvord Sabbath they pleaſe, as <hi>a</hi> Sabbath, and <hi>the</hi> Sabbath, and <hi>a</hi> Reſt; and all to this end, that they might dravv the 4th. Com. vnto the Lords day, and expound it of the Lords day, or Sunday; as if the name Sabbath day, might be giuen indifferently vnto any day of the weeke: none of vvhich corrupt gloſſes could delud the people, if they had the words Sabbath day tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated into Engliſh wordes; for ſo they need not, ſo vvholly rely vpon the Miniſters fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in Expoſition as novv they muſt: for they might ſee by their ovvne eyes plainly.</p>
                     <p>For example, ſuppoſe we the 4th. Com. were thus tranſlated, <hi>Remember the Saturday-Reſt, to ſanctifie it:</hi> if novv any doubt could be, vvhich ſhold be the day, appointed of God for Sabbath day, it vvould eaſily be decided, and that by an vnlearned man: if any ſhold offer to corrupt the text, by diſtinguiſhing of <hi>a</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, and <hi>the</hi> ſaturday (as they doe of a Sabbath: and the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: and of a 7th. day, and the 7th. day) as if there were more ſaturdayes in a vveeke then one, he vvould be laught at for his paines. Againe, if any would goe about to turne Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, from the Saturday to the Sunday, by this deuiſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word Sabbath ſignifieth a Reſt, and vve doe Reſt now from laboures on the Sunday, he vvold preſently be anſvvered, that thats a friuolouſe reaſon, for the 4th. Com. inioyneth not a <hi>Sunday-Reſt,</hi> but a <hi>Saturday-Reſt:</hi> laſtly, if any would be ſo idle,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21140:41"/>as to apply the 4th com. to the Lords day, and expound it, of the Lords day; why euery child would ſee his groſſe abuſe of the 4th com. for it directly ſpeaketh not of the Lords day, but of Saturday: For it is not the name Lords day, that God hath put into the 4th com. but the name Sabbath day, or Saturday.</p>
                     <p>Thus I haue ſhowne, what light would come vnto Gods commandement, by the tranſlation of the Hebrew word Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and what fruit would come vnto euery one in the Church of God thereby; if this I cannot obtaine, yet this at leaſt let me preuaile in, that Miniſters would be pleaſed hereafter in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of thoſe words Sabbathday, to ſignify vnto the people, that thereby is meant our Saturday: For this I haue proued abundantly and vndeniably both by Scriptures, and by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of both Iewes, and Chriſtians of all ſorts, Proteſtants and Papiſts: this duety therefore, in the true and faithfull expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Gods word vnto the people, I require of them, as they will anſwer the contrary before Almighty God, at that Day: let them bevvare of Sophiſticating with Gods lawes, when they expound them; In the 4th comm. God ſaid, Remember the Sabbath day: but he ſaid not, Remember the Sunday, or the Lords day; nor remember the Monday, the Tewſday, or the Wedneſday &amp;c. but remember the Sabbath day: Now looke which day of the weeke was euer in ancient time named and called Sabbath day, that is the day commanded in the 4th com. If then they can ſhew me, that either Sunday, Lords day, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, Tewſday, Wedneſday &amp;c. or any day beſids Saturday, was wont to be named and called Sabbath day, then may they haue ſome culler for their errour, but now haue they none.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond vſe, ſhall be againſt ſueh Miniſters, as doe either expound the 4th com. to belong to the Lords day, or Sunday, becauſe then we Reſt: or elſe, when the 4th com. is vrged vpon them, as requiring the ſeuenth day reſt, or Saturday-Reſt; they turne it off thus, the vvord Sabbath ſignifieth in Engliſh, a Reſt, now vpon the Lords day, or Sunday we reſt: wherevnto I reply, 1. that thus when God appointed the 7th day, for his Sabbath day, in his 4th com. the people of the Iewes might thus haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered God, that the vvord Sabbath in his 4th com. ſignifieth a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21140:41"/>Reſt, now when they keepe any one of thoſe yeerely Sabbaths in Leuit. 23. they might ſay, this vveeke vve haue kept one of thoſe annuall Sabbaths, (ſuppoſe it fell vpon Tewſday or Wenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day) and in this day we had a Reſt: by this faire glooſe, might not God looſe in that vveeke, his morall weekly Sabbath, inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the 4th com. which fell vpon Saturday? and that becauſe they kept a ceremoniall yeerly Sabbath, that weeke, vpon the Tevvſday or Wenſday? for vpon this Tevvſday or Wenſday, they did Reſt. What iugling trickes are theſe? vvould a man beleeue it, that Puritane Miniſters, profeſſing the feare of God, vvould vſe ſuch diſſimulation, and handle the vvord of God ſo craftily? pardon me good Reader, hovv euer I reuerence their holy profeſſion, yet I cannot ſpeake of this their vile abuſe, of Gods ſacred vvord, vvithout indignation of ſpirit: vvho that ſincerly loueth God, and his ſacred Scriptures, can paſſe it ouer in ſilence, to ſee his holy vvord thus vvreſted, and baſely abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed!</p>
                     <p>Chriſtmas day, vvhen it falleth vpon ſome one of the ſix wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dayes; and ſo the Coronation day; and ſo thos common ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes, S. Mathews day, S. Iohns day, and the reſt; tis true, we Reſt vpon theſe dayes from our labours, and that by an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of our Church; but will any be ſo abſurd as to ſay, that theſe holy dayes ſtand by vertue of the 4th comm. becauſe we Reſt on theſe dayes? or ſuppoſe the patrones of the Lords day, vvho preſſe the 4th comm. vpon it, ſhould vrge me, to ſanctifie the Lords day, by the 4th com. might not I anſwer them in their owne anſwer, that the word Sabbath in the 4th com. it ſignifieth a Reſt; novv on Chriſtmas day, and on Coronation day, and on S. Matthews day &amp;c. vve Reſt? Secondly I reply, be it that on the Lords day, we reſt, vvhy this is not the reſt, ſpoken of in the 4th com. for this is a Lords-day-Reſt, but the com. calleth for a Saturday-Reſt: this is a firſt-day-reſt, but the com. calleth for a Seuenth-day-reſt: this difference is bigge enough to be ſeene. Finally, if ſuch anſvvers be lavvfull, then vvhen wee meete with the name Ieſus, in a text wherin it is manifeſtly meant, of Chriſt our Lord; yet then may vve ſay, vvhy Ieſus, it ſignifieth a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, now Ioſhua vvas a Sauiour, for he ſaued the Iſraelits from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21140:42"/>the Canaanites &amp;c. but ſhall ſuch cauilles goe for currant? as by theſe trickes, ſome men turne off the Lords Sabbathes, ſo by the like, may they turne off alſo, the Lord Ieſus, their Sauiour: it is but to play the foole a little, with the name Ieſus, as they doe with the name Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>A third vſe ſhall be againſt ſuch Miniſters, as doe not onely in priuate, but alſo in publike, in their Pulpites, call, or miſcall rather, the Lords day, Sabbath day, in reference to the 4th com. by reaſon of whoſe errour, the people alſo haue learned to nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name the Lords day, calling it, the Sabbath day: But vvhat an horrible confuſion of times, and the proper names of dayes, is this? If this may goe on, err long vvee ſhall ſcarce know one day of the weeke, from another: may not vve, as vvell call our Saturday, Sunday; or our Sunday, Saturday; as call our Sunday, Sabbath day, which is Saturday? if we ſhall make proper names of things, common names, vvhat an intollerable confuſion doe we bring in to the vvorld? Yet further, if vve may call the Lords day, which is holden to be a new inſtitution, Sabbath day, by an old name; why may we not call Baptiſme, which is a nevv inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> by an old name? and vvhy may we not call the Lords Supper, which is a new inſtitution, <hi>the Paſſeouer,</hi> by an old name? For as Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, are come in the roome of Circumciſion, and the Paſſeouer, ſo it is ſaid, that the Lords day, is come in the roome of the Sabbath day? Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, this nicknaming of dayes, as full of confuſion as it is; and as improper as the ſpeech is; yet it might be borne, if it were not of euill conſequence; for hereby the poore ignorant people are deluded; and hereby they are brought off the more aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beleeue, that the 4th comm. doth bind them to reſt from their labours on the Lords day: but to the contrary, vve haue proued, that the 4th com. doth bind onely to the 7th day, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday. Yea, I adde, that men may as vvel ſay, they eat Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall bread at their common Tables, and that they celebrate the Lords Supper, when they eat bread and drinke vvine at their common Tables, as to ſay, they ſanctify the Sabbath day, vvhen on the Lords day they heare a Sermon, pray, and ſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>: for the difference betvvixt the Sabbath day, and the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21140:42"/>Lords day, is as great, as is the difference betvvixt the Lords Supper, and our common Suppers, betvvixt Sacramentall bread and vvine, and common bread and vvine, as ſhall be ſhowne.</p>
                     <p>The name Sabbath day, may be conſidered as diuinly impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by God him ſelfe vpon a certaine day, or as humanly impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by man; novv of all the dayes in the weeke, God impoſed the name Sabbath day, onely vpon ſaturday, the ſeuenth day of the weeke: if therefore we vvill take God for our guide, vve are to call no day Sabbath day, in reuerence to his 4th. com. but that day which God himſelfe hath named Sabbath day: but as for the Lords day, it is no where in all the ſcriptures called Sabbath day; let the patrones of this day, ſhew where in all the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, the firſt day of the weeke, or Sunday, is called Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day: the which ſince they cannot doe, it is altogether grovvndleſſe ſo to name it, yet further, wheras it is ſuppoſed that the Lords day, was ſet vp for a new Sabbath, at Chriſt his reſurrection, yet, as it is to be noted, this day, had no nevv na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me put vpon it, of many yeeres after that, but it was ſtill called by its old name, to wit, the firſt day of the weeke, as we read in all the 4. Euangeliſts, yea and when it vvas named Lords day, in Reu. 1.10. yet it was not named Sabbath day, then nor at any time elſe: this name then Sabbath day, being put vpon our ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, it is not of Gods impoſition, but of mans impoſition; and ſo tis but humane; it vvere to be wiſhed then, that men vvould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conforme theire ſpeech vnto God then vnto man; calling Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, the Sabbath day, as God did; and not Sunday the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, as man doth.</p>
                     <p>It vvere the more tollerable I confeſſe, if there were ſuch a penury of words, and ſcarcety of names, as vve had no other name for our Sunday: but vve haue 3 ſeuerall names for it, to wit, 1. Sunday, 2. the Lords day. 3. the firſt day of the vveeke: here are names enough for one day; thers no neceſſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to robb the ſeuenth day, of its name, that ſo we might haue 4. names for one day: no no, it is not penury of names, but thers an other matter in it: the name <hi>Sabbath day</hi> it is an auncient name, and it is an honourable name, and God had made his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to ſuch as kept his Sabbathes? <hi>if thou turne away thy foore

Then I will cauſe thee to ride vpon the high places of the earth, and feede the with the Heritag of Iacob,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 58.13.14. And the violation of this Sabbath day. God had ſeuerly puniſhed, as we reade, Numb: 15.32.35. and Nehem. 13.18. Whereby God from heauen hath ſhovvne in what eſteeme he had this day. yea this Sabbath day, God him ſelfe kept it, and alſo hee Sanctified it, and bleſſed is, Geneſ. 2.3. yet further, God hath giuen a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall commandement for this day, and put it in Tables of ſtone, vttered it vvith his owne voice, and vvrote it vvith his ovvne ſinger, Exod. 20. thus hath God honoured this day; wherefore the name of it, is alſo honourable: novv the Patrones of our Lords day, ſeing all this, and finding no ſuch honour put vpon their Lords day hence it is, that they might aduance the Lords day, in the minds of the multitude, they haue robbed the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day of all its honourable ornaments, that there vvith all they might decke vp and trimme vp the Lords day; and hence it is, that our Sunday, muſt needs be called the Sabbath day; and ſo by this meanes, all thoſe Scriptures which mention any thing of the Lords Sabbathes any vvhere, they are together vvith the name, tranſlated vnto the Lords day; vvhat is this, but to robb the Miſtris of hir Iewels, to beſtow them vpon the handmaide? to take the honour due vnto the Maſter, and giue it vnto the ſeruant? or to take the Crovvne from off the head of the King, to ſett it vpon a common ſubiect? for, as for the Lords day, it is but a common working day, in Gods account, it being one of thoſe ſix dayes, vvherin God ſaid, <hi>Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour,</hi> Exod. 20.9.</p>
                     <p>Tis true, vve receiued a greate bleſſing on that day, becauſe our Lord roſe then from the dead, and tis as true alſo that vve receiued a greate bleſſing on friday becauſe on that day, our Lord laid dovvne his liefe for vs, and ſuffered vpon the Croſſe, and yet for al that, friday is accounted but for a common vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king day, for one of the ſixe dayes, vvherin vve muſt labour: yet further, the Lords day is but a common day, in reſpect of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, as touching all thos particulares mentioned before; for the name Lords day, it is but nevv, and put vpon Sunday, but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21140:43"/>ſince Chriſt and that many yeerers too ſince Chriſt: but the name Sabbath day, it is auncient, and put vpon the Saturday thovvſands of yeeres before Chriſt: againe, you no vvhere read of any bleſſings promiſed by God, in all the New Teſtament, to thoſe which Keepe the Lords day Holy: nor of any iudgments inflicted, or threatened vpon any, that worke on the Lords day: further you no where in all the Nevv Teſtament, find any commandement, to keep the Lords day Holy. No nor can it be ſhowne that Chriſt euer Kept it: In a vvord, God neuer hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved the Lords day, nor bleſſed and ſanctified it, vvhereby it ſhold become an holy day; but all theſe and more, God did to the Saterday; therefore is the Saturday, as the King or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſe, to the Lords day: as then the King and all good ſubiects, wold think amiſſe of him, that taketh the crowne off the King, and ſet it vpon the head of a common ſubiect, yea though he were aboue a common ſubiect, as is a knight, or a Noble man, and as Friday, and Sunday in ſome ſenſe are aboue the other of the ſixe dayes: So no doubt will God, and ſo ſhold euery Godly man, think amiſſe of it, to heare Miniſters take that name of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, from off the head of Saturday, to ſet it vpon the head of Sunday.</p>
                     <p>By this tranſlating of the name Sabbath day, from Saturday to Sunday, common people, when they read in the Scriptures, of any thing of note, touching the Sabbath day, preſently they caſt that in theyre minds vpon the Lords day, thinking that to be meant of it: thus being meerly deluded, they honour the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect for the king, the maide for hir Miſtris, and miſapply and abuſe all thoſe Textes of Scripture; is it not high time then, that this abuſe were Looked vnto? and the rather alſo, becauſe by theire carrynig of the name Sabbath day, from the Saturday, vnto the Sunday; they hereby doe ſubtilly carry alſo, the 4th commandement from the Saturday, vnto the Sunday: and thus they robb the Saturday, both of its diuine name, and alſo of its Commandement; for novv, no man cales the Saturday, Sabbath day; nor applies the fourth com. vnto it at all: by this robbery God and his Sabbathes are leeſers, but they are greate gainers, for novv they haue not only got that deuine name, Sabbath day,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21140:44"/>for theire Sunday, but alſo they haue got (though but by vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation) a Commandement too for theire Lords day, the which had no commandement before. It bewraieth theire beggarly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in ornaments for the Lords day, when they muſt thus robb and pull from an other day, to clothe and attire it vvith all: neither hath the Lords day, any thing in the nevv Teſtament, to tye mens conſciences with all, but only what the patrones there of, haue vniuſtly taken out of the Old Teſtament, from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday Sabbath, and out of whoſe ruines, they haue erected a nevv day. For concluſion, let me exhorte Miniſters, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to refraine putting the name Sabbath day, vpon the Lords day, for hereafter; we haue names enough beſids, we may call it, Sunday, Lords day, or Firſt day of the weeke; doe not mocke God, and deceiue the world any longer, vvith vſe of the name Sabbath day, vnleſſe you meant to giue God his proper Sabbath day, the Saturday; why ſhould you retaine the name with out the thing? this is to mocke God, with a ſhaddovv for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p>And here I cannot but ſpeake of that common fault of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the pulpit, vvhoſe very words, and vvorkes are at iarr, the more is the pitty: for in application of theire doctrines, they are frequent, in preſſing the obſeruation of the Sabbath day, amongſt other virtues, and holy dueties; and on the contrary, in many of there vſes of reprofe, they are very zealouſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing the breach of the Lords Sabbaths, together vvith other ſinnes of drunkenneſſe, Svvearing, lying, oppreſſion, pride, and the like; vvherein they doe very well, if their words and their vvorkes vvent together; if their words, and their mind did agree, for aske them in priuate, vvhat day of the vveeke, they meant by the name Sabbath day, and they vvill tell you Sunday or Lords day: ſo then, with their toungs, they call for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, which is Saturday in Gods account, as hath bene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; but they meane an other thing then they ſpeake of; for they meane it of Sunday or Lords day: like as if a man ſhould talke much and erneſtly of Saturday, but meaneth it of friday: or, of Sunday, and meaneth it of Moneday. Nay their ovvne mouthes ſhall condemne them, for they call for the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21140:44"/>in the pulpit, vvhen they profane them in theire families, and teach men ſo to doe; nay the Lords Sabbathes, find no greater enemies, then theſe who call ſo much for them; for they at other times, vvill beare the people in hand that they are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; and they vvill and dare vndertake to proue, that that Sabbath day, once commanded in the 4th com. is a ceremony, and aboliſhed; and yet theſe men, I will haue the Sabbath of the Lord, ſtill in their mouthes, and make a great clamour for it: the Prophet Ieremiah reprooued thoſe of his time, ſaying, <hi>Truſt ye not in lying words, ſaying, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> Ierem. 7.4. And may not I ſay, of our time, forbeare your homonymiouſe and double meaning ſpeeches; refraine your words of aequiuocation, and of mentall reſeruation, ſaying, the Sabbaths of the Lord, the Sabbaths of the Lord: either be right dovvne for the Lords Sabbaths, before the people; or elſe let them be no more heard in your mouths: doe not abuſe that proper name Sabbath day, diuinely impoſed by God, vpon our Saturday; and by your aequiuocations, and mentall reſeruations, meane it of Sunday.</p>
                     <p>Happily, I ſhall preuaile vvith ſome, to forſake the abuſe of this name, and in ſtead of it, they will call our Sunday, the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and ſo preſſe the ſanctification of it vnder that name. To ſuch I ſay, let them doe ſo then, if they can find any grounds out of Gods vvord, to vvarrant them to preſſe the Lords day, to be kept as the Sabbath day; but this let them take with it, that they muſt with the forbearing of the name Sabbath day, refraine the vſe of the 4th com. alſo; for theſe goe inſeparablie together; they muſt not preſſe the 4th com. vpon the Lords day; for the 4th com. ſpeaketh of a day, vvhich by diuine impoſition, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> and not of a day vvhich by humane impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is called ſo, as hitherto many of their owne braines doe; or not of a day, called the <hi>Lords day:</hi> the com. runneth thus, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sabbath day &amp;c. not thus, Remember the Lords day, &amp;c. Some there are, vvho allredy, of their ovvne accord, doe call our Sunday, Lords day, and not Sabbath day: but I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile of all the reſt, vvith vvhat face, theſe men can preſſe the 4th comm. vpon that day, vvhich themſelues confeſſe is named
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21140:45"/>
                        <hi>Lords day,</hi> and not Sabbath day: vvhen as the 4th comm. doth expreſly mention a day, which is named <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> and not <hi>Lords day.</hi> The name Sabbath day therefore, and the 4th com. muſt goe inſeperably together; hold the one and hold the other, renownce the one and renownce the other alſo.</p>
                     <p>A fourth vſe, ſhall be for the confutation of a common, but very friuolouſe anſwer; let a man vrge the 4th com. for the 7th day, or Saturday Sabbath; and preſently their anſwere will be, that the com. may be vnderſtood not of <hi>the</hi> Sabbath day, but of <hi>a</hi> Sabbath day. But that I may diſcouer the idleneſſe of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt inction, and ſuch as vſe it; firſt vve muſt vnderſtand what they meane by it; by <hi>the</hi> Sabbath day, they meane that certaine knowne day, called the 7th day from the creation, which is our Saturday: and by <hi>a</hi> Sabbath day, they meane, ſome vncertaine day, as one or other of the 7 dayes, but not determined which, whither this or that: novv ſay they, the com. may be vnderſtood either of theſe wayes, for the vvord Sabbath, it may be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either <hi>a</hi> Sabbath, or <hi>the</hi> Sabbath: either of a day certaine, or of a day vncertaine. Herevnto I reply, admit we ſhould grant them, that the com. may be vnderſtood of a Sabbath, vncertaine which; yet by Sabbath, they muſt meane a Sabbath day, whoſe name is of diuine impoſition; well, can they now ſhew vs any day of the vveeke, ſaue Saturday, that is named by God in holy Scripture, Sabbath day? ſure I am they cannot: If then, they cannot ſhew vs, any day in the vveeke, called in Scripture Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day but Saturday, muſt they not be inforced then to apply the 4th com. to the Saturday, and to it alone?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By the like licentiouſe libertie in expounding of Scriptures, we may make moſt things that are certaine, and well knovvne which, to become vncertaine, and vnknowne which: for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> vvhen the text declareth that it is ſpoken of Chriſt our Sauiour, might not a vvrangler ſhift it off alſo, by this anſvver, that the name Ieſus, it may be tranſlated <hi>a</hi> Ieſus, or <hi>the</hi> Ieſus &amp;c. and ſo ſay that that text may be meant of a Ieſus, as Ioſhua, or vncertainly which Ieſus; and not of the Ieſus, which is Chriſt? Againe, whereas tis ſaid, <hi>I was in the Spirit on (the) Lords day:</hi> that is, on Sunday, ſay they: well, may not I anſwer
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21140:45"/>them, as they anſwer mee, ſaying, it may be tranſlated <hi>a</hi> Lords day, or <hi>the</hi> Lords day; and ſo it may be meant of ſome other day beſides Sunday? let a man read ouer 3 or 4 verſes in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the firſt chapter of Geneſis, and let him in ſtead of <hi>the</hi> where he find it, put <hi>a,</hi> and he will be aſhamed of his ſoreading it; yet further, why might not the Iewes, haue the diſtinction of a Paſſeouer, and of the Paſſeouer? and of a Pentecoſt, and the Pentecoſt? as well as a Sabbath, and the Sabbath? And why may not vve haue a Lords day, and the Lords day; a Chriſtmas day, and the Chriſtmas day; an Eaſter day, and the Eaſter day; as well as a Sabbath day and the Sabbath day? To conclude, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we that Chriſt had left an expreſſe commandement in the New Teſtament for the Lords day, in theſe words, <hi>Remember the Lords day to ſanctifie it:</hi> how would the patrones of the Lords day Sabbath rage and ſtorme, to heare any goe about to wreſt this commandement of Chriſts, from Sunday the firſt day of the vveeke, vnto ſome other day, as to Saturday, or to Monday &amp;c? and yet in a ſenſe euery day of the vveeke is the Lords day: I deſire them but to deale with Gods 4th com. which mentioneth the Sabbath day, like as they vvould haue others deale vvith the Lords day, if it were commanded.</p>
                     <p>I come now to ſhew that by Sabbath day, in the 4th comm. is meant not an <hi>vnknowne</hi> and <hi>vncortaine</hi> day, but a <hi>certaine</hi> and well knovvne day: not <hi>a</hi> Sabbath day, but <hi>the</hi> Sabbath day; (novv this hath bene ſufficiently proued before, neuertheleſſe I vvill proue it furrher, becauſe ſome thinke, that the name Sabbath day may as vvell be applied vnto Sunday as to Saturday, and ſo the 4th comm. may hold its morallity in binding vnto Sunday:) and firſt I vvill begin vvith the Teſtimony of all <hi>Tranſlators,</hi> both new and old; looke into all our Engliſh Bibles, both old and nevvly tranſlated, and you ſhall find that not only in the 4th com. but alſo conſtantly, in all other places of Scriptute, vvhere is any mention of this name Sabbath day, and you ſhall find them tranſlating it, not <hi>a</hi> Sabbath, but <hi>the</hi> Sabbath: which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth cleerly, that hovv euer the word may be rendred <hi>a</hi> Sabbath, yet that tranſlation is not the beſt, and therefore they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected it, and haue vnanimouſly tranſlated it <hi>the</hi> Sabbath: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21140:46"/>is this done by any that fauoured the 7th day Sabbath, but by thoſe vvho rather fauoured the Lords day, and therefore no doubt, but they would haue made ſome way for the Lords day, by this their tranſlation, if it could haue bene.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Lord hath in the very com. it ſelfe, limited the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath vnto a certaine and knowne day, and that 1. by its proper name Sabbath day, vvhich belonged properly vnto our Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, not indefinitly and in common to any day; as hath bene ſhovvne. 2. By deciphering it out moſt plainly, to be the 7th and laſt day of the weeke, in theſe vvords, <hi>But the 7th day, is the Sabbath</hi> &amp;c. Now the 7th day, is not vncertaine which day of the vveeke it is; but well knovvne to be Saturday the laſt day of the weeke. 3. It is that very day, vvhich muſt be ſanctified by man, vvhich God himſelfe ſanctified, and ſet vs for a patterne, to vvit, the 7th day from the creation; as vve haue it in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon aſſizmed to the com. Exod. 20.11. Novv the day vvhich God reſted on, and the day which God bleſſed and ſanctified, is a certaine and knowne day, ſee Gen. 2.3. it was <hi>the</hi> 7th day, not <hi>a</hi> 7th day.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I proue that the Sabbath ſpake of in the Comm. was a certaine knowne day, and not an vncertaine day, partly by the Teſtimony of Moſes, Exo. 16.23. where vpon the ſixth day of the weeke, v. 22. Moſes teld the people thus, ſaying, <hi>To mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is the reſt of the Holy Sabbath,</hi> &amp;c. ſo then the time of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath it was a certaine knowne time, and ſo certaine and ſo knovvne, that Moſes could ſay of it, the day before it came, <hi>To morrow,</hi> it ſhall be, &amp;c. ſo much alſo may be collected out of, Luk. 13.14. and Act. 13.42.44. Finally, I proue it by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all diuines, vvho affirme that our Saturday, vvas the Iewes Sabbath day, which they Kept by virtue of the 4th com. vntill Chriſt came, as elſe where I haue already, proued more lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly: Novv if Saturday were the day which they kept for the Sabbath day, then by the practiſe of all the Church of the Iewes vntill Chriſt, the Sabbath day vvas a certaine knovvne day, euen as our Saturday, is a certaine day.</p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:21140:46"/>
                     <p> Thus I haue proued vndeniably, that the Sabbath day, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned in the 4th com. it was the Sabbath not <hi>a</hi> Sabbath; it vvas a day <hi>certaine,</hi> and not <hi>vncertaine,</hi> it vvas not vnderſtood of <hi>ſome one day</hi> of the weeke indiſtinctly, but of one certaine vvell knowne day of the weeke; which being ſo, hovv fondly, yea wickedly and profanly haue they done, who by their falſe gloſſes and idle diſtinctions, doe labour to make people beleeue, that Gods certaine and knovvne times for his worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, are vncertaine, and vndetermined: that ſo they might alter and change Gods times, and make way for their humane inventiones, that is, to ſet the Lords day into the 4th com. you haue ſeene it ſufficiently proued, that Saturday vvas the Sabbath day for thovvſands of yeers, vntill Chriſt; and that by the name Sabbath day, was no other day knowne nor vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but only Saturday, vntill Chriſt: how vaine then are thoſe men, vvho vvould novv a dayes haue a nevv ſenſe of the name Sabbath day? for vntill Chriſt, theſe words Sabbath day, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>the</hi> Sabbath day, but novv ſince Chriſt, they muſt ſignify <hi>a</hi> Sabbath day: then they ſignified the Saturday, but novv they muſt ſignify the Sunday, or Lords day: was euer ſuch madneſſe heard of before? muſt vvords be mutable, and chang their ſenſe, with the chang of times? that one vvord, in diuerſe Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, may ſignify diuerſly is not ſtrang; but that one word or name, in one &amp; the ſame Text, ſhould for thovvſands of yeeres, ſignify one thing; and the ſelfe ſame word or name, after thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of yeers, then ſhould haue an other ſenſe, it is matchleſſe; this may be the queene of all abſurdeties: &amp; yet thus abſurd are all they, who would by their diſtinction of <hi>a</hi> and <hi>the</hi> Sabbath, and the like, bring the Sunday or Lords day, novv into the 4th. com. and turne away the 7th. day: The approach of the goſpell, hath not altered the ſenſe of words in the lavv: for theſe words, paſſeouer, Circumciſion, &amp; Sacrifice, though they be aboliſhed, and we haue others in their roome, yet thoſe words, in the ſame Textes, doe ſignify now none other thing, then they were vvont to doe: muſt only the word Sabbath be changed in its ſenſe? If words in the Old Teſtament ſhall haue one ſenſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt came, and an other ſenſe after his coming, there
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21140:47"/>vvil be no certainty of the ſenſe of any of the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament. This is quite to ouerturne all certainty of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Were a man but to conſtrue a peece of lattine, out of ſome profane Author, <hi>Terence,</hi> or the like, and ſhould Engeliſh a word in a different ſenſe, from that ſenſe which vvas vſed in that Authores time, and diuerſe from all Dictionaries and the like, vvould it be borne with all thinke we? and yet many of our diuines, vvill deale worſe with Gods ſacred Scriptures, then vvith a profane Author, for albeit the word Sabbath, vvas euer vſed in the Scriptures, for Saturday, and ſo in our Dictionaries alſo, yet they will haue one fooliſh anſvver, or diſtinction or other, vvhereby they vvill turne off the Saturday, to bring in the Sunday, into the name Sabbath day, and into the 4th. com. yea, and neuer ſo much as bluſh at it neither: iudg good Reader, if the Scriptures be not fouly and ſhamfully abuſed by theſe men, vvhen they vvill by their corrupt Expoſitions of the 4th com. offer that violence vnto it, that all men are a ſhamed to offer vnto A profane Authour, as <hi>Terence</hi> or the like: But haue you no more care of the ſoules of thoſe God hath committed to your charge, then thus to vſe your vvites, to blind their eyes, leaſt they ſhould ſe the trueth, and vvalke in the vvay of Gods 4th com? ſe to it in time, if Sabbath day, did once ſignify the Saturday, it muſt ſo ſignify to the vvorlds end.</p>
                     <p>Thus farr I haue laboured, to vindicate Gods 4th com. from the corruptiones of the time: but before I paſſe this point, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to lay before the eyes of our Miniſters, tvvo notoriouſe abuſes; the one is the abuſe of theire flockes, the people of God: the other is the abuſe of Gods ſacred vvord: for the former, by their corrupt preſſing the 4th com. ſo hard vpon the conſciences of their people, for the Sanctifying of the Lords day, they haue drawne many well affected people, to a great deale of zeale in keeping it holy, in ſo much as many doe, in conſcience of the 4th com. heare tvvo Sermones in a day, if not in ſome places 3 or 4: they reade the ſcriptures priuatly at home, they refraine all ſeruile labour all the day long, they refraine ſo much as to talke of vvorldly buſineſſes, they neglect their gaine and proffites, which elſe they might haue; yea oft they ſuſtaine loſſe, and all

Sam. 13.9.10. &amp;c. ſo it is here, they doe fooliſhly that alter Gods dayes and times, and they ſhall leeſe their ſhare of thoſe bleſſings, which God hath promiſed vnto them that keepe his Sabbathes, Iſa. 58.13.14. becauſe they kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe not his Sabbaths but their Lords dayes: and they doe foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly, becauſe they think as Saul did, to pleaſe God vvith an halfe ſeruice, doeing ſomthings which God commanded, and leauing out and vndone otherſome thing which God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Sauls obedience came ſhorte in the circumſtance of the perſon, and therfore reiected: and theſe men that keepe the Lords day, but not the Sabbath day, their obedience faleth ſhort in the circumſtance of the time, Gods Sacred day, and therfore will be reiected of God. Let them looke too it, and receiue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition. And further whereas they pleaſe them ſelues ſaying, they haue the dueties of the Sabbath, though they haue not the time: they muſt know, that for ſo much as the day and preciſe time, is as expreſly commanded in the 4th com. as are Reſt and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21140:48"/>holy exerciſes, therfore the day and preciſe time, is no leſſe a duety, then are other things commanded in the ſame Com. ſo then when they pleaſe themſelues ſaying, they haue the dueties of the Sabbath and neglect that day and time, they haue but one halfe or ſome partes of the Sabbathes duties: for they want the ſett time, which is a parte of the Sabbathes duetie: yea, and ſuch a parte too, as being vvanting, the dueties of reſt and holy excerciſes, become no better then common holy dayes dueties: for on euery common holy day they doe ſuch Sabbath dueties, that is, they Reſt, and heare Sermones, &amp;c. Novv to returne, if through the falſe Expoſition of Gods 4th com. Gods people be led into ſuch an errour, by keeping a vvrong day, as they ſhall leeſe the revvard of their expected hopes; and their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in reſpect of this day, become a ſuperſtition; and their conſcience of the 4th Com. proue a non-obedience vnto it, is it not high time that this matter be looked vnto? and haue not Miniſters lamentablie abuſed the people?</p>
                     <p>Yet further, when people in their priuate family prayers, on Sunday morning, before they goe into the Congregation, pray to God to aſſiſt them and helpe them in the ſanctification of that day Sabbath, doe they not bable before God, making him beleeue that that preſent Sunday, is his ſacred Sabbath day, the vvhich God knoweth is moſt falſe? the ſame is true alſo of the Miniſter, vſing ſuch prayers, in his pulpit publikely. Againe, when night commeth, doe not ſuch as vſe to call vpon God morning and Euening, make an humble confeſſſion to God, in their priuat families, of their ſinnes, among which they rekone vp their failings in the ſanctification of that Sabbath day novv paſt, for one: thus they ignorantly confeſſe ſinnes vnto God, vvhich are no ſinnes; and feare vvhere no feare is; for, if a ſinne, it muſt be a tranſgreſſion of ſome law; but ſhew me a law, for the ſanctifying of the Lords day; thers one indeed for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, but none at all for the Lords day, neither in the old nor new Teſtaments: Novv doe not ſuch Miniſters lamentably abuſe their people, who by abuſiue expſitions of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, doe put a needleſſe conſcientie into men? and cauſe them to thinke that to be ſinne, vvhich is no ſinne: and which is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21140:49"/>worſe, cauſe them to acknowledge vnto God, more ſinnes then God himſelfe knowes; and to aske pardon, where they haue committed no offence: is it not high time, that God ſhould raiſe vp ſome man, to detect theſe errours? yis doubtleſſe; and the times vvill in an irefull diſpleaſure at him, for his honeſt paines, woefully reward him, in body, goods, and good name. Thus far of Miniſters abuſing of the people of God, committed to their charge.</p>
                     <p>I come novv to Miniſters abuſe of the ſacred, word of God, a thing to be thought on: let a man trauaile vpon the Lords day: or doe any common worke, preſently they charg him with a breach of the 4th com. and with a profanation of the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day: a gaine, in their pulpites, to dravv men to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Lords day, they vrg hard the 4th com. vpon the Lords day; yea, they apply alſo to the Lords day, all thoſe Scriptures, which any where mention the Sabbath day, and were made properly and ſolely, for it; as Numb. 15.32. &amp;c. and Nehem. 13.18. where is mention made, of Gods iudgments, for profanation of the Sabbath day: and Iſa. 58.13.14. where is mention made of the holy manner of keeping the Sabbath day; and of bleſſings promiſed there vnto: novv they making no difference, betwene the Sabbath day, and the Lords day, doe apply all theſe Scriptures with others, vnto the Lords day, which are proper vnto the Sabbath day: but thus doing, they abuſe theſe Scriptures, and profane the vvord of God; and thus I make it good; as for the Lords day, it is but a common working day; for it is one of thoſe ſixe dayes, wherin God hath commanded vs in the 4th com. to doe our workes in; and it is the firſt of thoſe ſix dayes, called in Scripture, not Sabbath day, but by an old name conſtantly, to wit, the firſt day of the weke and be it, that we receiued a greate bleſſing on this day, to wit, Chriſt from the dead: ſo we receiued alſo on Friday, an other greate bleſſing, to wit, the Remiſſion of our ſinnes, by Chriſt his paſſion and ſufferance that day vpon the Croſſe for vs; and yet Friday remaineth a common working day, for all that; and ſo may, and doth Sunday, or the Lords day alſo: if then the Lords day, be but a common day, and Miniſters will apply
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21140:49"/>Gods ſacred vvord, which vvas deſtinated and ordeined for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and holy time, vnto common and profane time, is not this to abuſe and profane the holy and ſacred vvord of God?</p>
                     <p>If any ſhall object, that the time of the Sabbath day, is not an holy time and the like I anſvver, that as the Temple was an holy place, ſo the 7th day, or the Sabbath day, is an holy time, and an holy day; for God himſelfe made it holy, when he <hi>bleſſed the 7th day, and ſanctified</hi> it, Geneſ. 2.3. like as then, it is counted an vnſufferable profanation of Gods vvord, for any Miniſter, to pronounce the words of holy Baptiſme, <hi>I Baptize thee in the name of the father,</hi> &amp;c. vpon a child, when he waſheth his hands in common vvater: or to pronounce thoſe vvords of the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, <hi>Take eate this is my body,</hi> &amp;c. to a man, to whom the Miniſter giueth common bread, at his Table in is priuate houſe: ſo I iudge it, an horrible profanation of Gods Sacred vvord, for any Miniſter, to take that parte of Gods vvord, to wit, the 4th com. vvith thoſe other Scriptures, vvhich vvere peculiarly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated of God, for his ſacred Sabbathes, and to apply them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanly to the Lords day, which is and common &amp; vvorking day, as Friday is, in a right account.</p>
                     <p>Thus I haue out of that zeale I be are to Gods Lavv, and to Gods Sabbathes, declared vnto Miniſters, hovv they doe a buſe the people of God, on the one ſide; and profane the Sacred vvord of God, on the other ſide; and this I haue done, not to aggrauate their paſt ſinne, but (God knovveth) that they may preuent the like in time to come: but vvhat ſhall be done to the man, that hath diſcouered all this? will theſe Miniſters loue him for it? no they vvill hate him for it, and reuile him for it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute him, and ſay all manner of euill againſt him falſly, ſaying he is of a provvd ſpirit, to diſcouer any erroures in them, and the like: if it proue better, tis more then I looke for; and better then I haue found hither to: but I paſſe not for their diſpleſure, ſo be I may keepe a good conſcience to wards God: Miniſters muſt heare of their ſinnes as vvell as common people. And ſo much for the Expoſition of theſe vvords (Sabbath day) and for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the errours about them.</p>

                     <p>An other vſe of this pointe, is it ſo, that God hath charged vs to <hi>Remember</hi> his Sabbath <hi>day,</hi> vvhat vvill become of ſuch prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as are ſo farr off from a remembrance of it as that they teach men publikly to forget it? and to this euill end &amp; ſinnefull, they labour to be blurr Gods day, by calling it odiouſly Iewiſh and Ceremoniall: and to this end, they haue coined many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, wherby they would peruert the ſtraight vvay of the Lord, and put a ſtumbling blocke before the people, that ſo this thing commanded by God might be ſlighted; yea, they haue ſo handled the matter, and blered the eyes of the people, that they

                     <p>As theſe Miniſter ſhall vndoubtedly anſwer to God, for the ſinne of the people, in profanation of the Lords Sabbath weekly; ſo doe I vviſh and aduiſe all people, to lay the weight and perill of their ſoules, vpon theſe their Miniſters, vvho tach them thus: telling them plainly thus, we ſee a plaine and expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Almightie God for the Sabbath day, but vve ſee none for the Lords day; vvherefore vve dare not in our conſciences, ſpeake againſt the Sabbath day, no nor profane it, by that common light of vnderſtanding and conſcience which God hath giuen vs to iudg by: if we durſt truſt our ovvne iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vve durſt not but ſanctify the Sabbath day; and God knoweth, if you our Miniſters, vvere as vvilling as vve are, we vvould keepe it holy; vvherfore, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whereby it appeareth, that the whole fault is in their Miniſters; and therfore haue I aduiſed the people, to lay the waight and whole burden of this matter, vpon their Miniſters,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21140:51"/>to prouoke them to reforme and cale backe their erroniouſe Doctrines touching God Sabbathes, leaſt they haue the blood of many ſoules an other day laied to their charge.</p>
                     <p>An other vſe of this pointe, is againſt Miniſters alſo, and it is of exceeding greate conſequence, enough to cauſe the haire vpon their heads to ſtand right vp, and their hearts to tremble againe if there be any loue and feare of God left in them: it is this; Is it ſo, that Almightie God hath charged and commanded vs to Remember his Sabbath day, to ſanctify it; and to this end hath giuen vs his 4th com. how dangerouſe then, is the caſe of ſuch Miniſters, as haue by theire vaine diſtinctiones, and fond ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, not only aboliſhed the Lords Sabbath day it ſelfe, but alſo by aboliſhing it, haue quite and cleane for euer, ouer throwne all the 4th commandement alſo; ſo as the 4th com. ſhall novv ſtand among the 10 commandements, but as a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher of no vſe; behold vvhat hauocke ſome Puritane Miniſters haue made, that ſo they might make a way to bring in, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their Lords day Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>That it may appeare to the world, that I taxe them not cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, I proceed to proue what I haue ſaid; and that partly from their diſtinctions, and partly from their obiections: Firſt for their diſtinctions; they doe diſtinguiſh of the time in the 4th com. and of the dueties of reſt and holineſſe, in the time: Now for the time, the 7th day, and the Sabbath day, theſe are Iewiſh (ſay they) ceremoniall and aboliſhed: but the dueties in the time, they onely are morall and perpetuall: and to this head come all their other diſtinctions, and from hence they are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: vpon this diſtinction, thus I argue; <hi>If that time, that is, all that time which was commanded to the Iewes, and compriſed in theſe words (the 7th day) and (the Sabbath day) be a ceremony and aboliſhed as Iewiſh, then is there no time left in the 4th com. for any Sabbath day: But that time, that is, all that time, once commanded to the Iewes, and compriſed in theſe words (the 7th day, and, (the Sabbath day) is a ceremony and aboliſhed as Iew ſh: Therefore there is no time left in the 4th. com. for any Sabbath day: and, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, no 4th com.</hi> For the Minor, they cannot deny it; for it is a limme of their owne diſtinction; for they ſay (the 7th day) is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21140:51"/>aboliſhed, and (the Sabbath day) to wit, that ancient Sabbath day, commanded to the Iewes in the 4th com. that they ſay alſo, is, Iewiſh and aboliſhed: Wherefore vnleſſe they can ſhew vs ſome new Scripture, or ſome other partes of the 4th com. which haue hitherto laine hidden and vnknovvne, where there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of any other 7th day then one, and of any other Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that when they ſay, that that one 7th day, and that one Sabbath day, once comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Iewes in the 4th com. is aboliſhed, that then all the time once commanded, is aboliſhed; for, all the time then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, was that one 7th day time onely; and that one 7th day time, was all the time, that was commanded: take away then one, and you take avvay all. For the Major its conſequence, it is cleere of it ſelfe, That if all the commanded time, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, be aboliſhed; then there is no commanded time, left in the commandement, for a Sabbath day: for example, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man hath a garden, wherein are ſondry bedes of herbes, among the vvhich he hath one bedd of Tyme: If now the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner come and cut vp by the rootes, or roote out, and digge vp all that bedd of Tyme; may not a man ſoundly argue thus, that if all the Tyme in the garden be rooted vp, that then there is no Tyme left in the garden? Why ſo it is in our caſe, take away that time, that was commanded, and there is no time, that is, no commanded time. Thus you ſee, that by their aboliſhing of that very day and time, which the Iewes kept, to wit, that Sabbath day, and that 7th day, they haue aboliſhed all time out of the 4th com. ſo as novv it commandeth not any day, nor any time to be ſanctified.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place, I am to proue, that if there be no time left in the 4th com. that is, no commanded time; that then by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, there is no 4th com. in vſe, but that it is a meere Cipher. For this purpoſe, remember, they diſtinguiſhed of the things commanded, to be the time, and the dueties in the time: the time then being aboliſhed, as hath bene proued, and as they every where profeſſe to hold, there remaineth nothing in the commandement, as commanded, but the dueties in the time, to vvit, Reſt and holy actions, and for theſe dueties, there is no
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21140:52"/>commanded time left now, ſo that either the dueties, muſt fall to the ground, and be aboliſhed together with the time, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon would teach a man; for, the proper time or proper place for any thing being taken avvay, the action to be done in that time, or in that place, muſt needs be taken avvay alſo, and ſo the dueties muſt come to naught and be nullified, for vvant of a fit and proper time to doe them in: or, if any time be to be allotted for theſe dueties, (in caſe me may abſurdly ſuppoſe the dueties to ſurviue the time) it is not a commanded time; for thats gone and aboliſht, as they ſay; vvherefore it muſt be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different time, and at the vvill and pleaſure of men onely: or, at moſt, it muſt be no more time, then can by force of neceſſary conſequence, be collected for the performance of thos dueties, Reſt, and holineſſe: vvell then to proceed, let vs ſee vvhat time it is which they can collect: ſure I am, that from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dueties of Reſt and holineſſe, as they ſtand in the 4th com. they can collect no more but this, that if God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, theſe dueties of Reſt and holineſſe, to be performed; then there muſt be a time, or ſome time allotted out by man, for the performance thereof.</p>
                     <p>Now be it granted, that ſome time muſt be allowed for theſe dueties; the queſtion then is 1. when that time muſt be? 2. How often that time muſt be? 3. Hovv long that time muſt be? For ſo much as novv by their opinions, the time of the 4th com. is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly aboliſhed, therefore thes queſtions cannot be ſatisfied by the 4th com. the Church therefore muſt determine them. To the firſt then I anſvver, vvhen muſt the time, or Sabbath be? why euen then, vvhen men pleaſe it ſhould be, as they can agree vpon the matter: This age may appoint it, at one time, an other age may appoint it at an other time. To the ſecond queſtion I anſwer for them, hovv often muſt that time be, for performance of thes dueties of the Sabbath? vvhy, ſince thoſe vvords <hi>the 7th day is the Sabbath,</hi> Exod. 20.10. be aboliſhed vvhich taught vs hovv often to keepe a Sabbath day, to vvit, euery 7th day; vvhy novv vve are left to our choiſe and liberty; for novv, vve are not by Gods commandement, nor by any neceſſity of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in reſpect of the dueties, vrged to giue God a Sabbath
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21140:52"/>day, frequently, but the Commandement may be throughly fulfilled, if we giue God a day, either once in euery 7 dayes, or once in euery 14 dayes, or once in euery 21 dayes; or once in a moneth, or once in a yeere, or once in 7 yeere, or once in a mans liefe: ſo be that once in a mans liefe, a man doth Reſt and performe holy exerciſes, a vvhole day long, he hath fulfilled the Commandement; for it requireth by their doctrine, novv no more, but Reſt and holineſſe a day long, vvith out any mention hovv often. To the third queſtion, I anſwer for them, hovv long muſt that time be, vvhen it cometh? vvhy, not a day long; for the <hi>time,</hi> and the vvord <hi>Day</hi> in the 4th Com. is aboliſhed (ſay they) ſo then, novv the Com. requireth not a day to begi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen God, vvhither a day of 12 or of 24 hovvres: it only requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the duties of Reſt and holineſſe: vvell then, if the Church giue God but one hovvre in a day, vvhen the day commeth, in the duties of Reſt and holineſſe, the com. is fulfilled; and thus the Church, needeth not, vnleſſe they vvill, giue God any other Sabbath, but one hovvre vpon ſome one day by hearing a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; for all that hovvre they performe the duties of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, to vvit, Reſt, and holineſſe: ſo then to ſumm vp the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath which thes Miniſters muſt haue; It is a Reſt from labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and an holy exerciſe of prayer vvith the Miniſter, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening vnto Gods vvord preacht, an vvholl hovvre long; and that once in a vveeke, or once in a moneth, or once in 7 yeeres; or once in a mans lief time, behould your Sabbath? One thing I muſt remember you of, vvhich is this, that Gods time being aboliſhed, this time of an hovvre or the like, vvhich comes now by force of collection, it is not a Diuine time, but an Humane time; ſo the com. is embaſed, by the chang of a Diuine time, for an Humane time. Iudg novv Chriſtian reader, if by theire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, houlding the time in the com. ceremoniall, they haue not nullified with the time, the vvholl 4th Comm. alſo: for, 1. vvhereas the time, ſhould be at Gods appointement, when? novv they haue brought it to be at manes appointement, when he vvill. 2. vvheras the Sabbath day vvas frequent, once in 7 dayes; now it needeth not be once in 7 yeeres. 3. vvheras the Sabbath vvas a day longe; novv it needeth not by the 4th com.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21140:53"/>be aboue an houre long: vvheras then the Commandement was, Remember the Sabbath day: now it may rune thus, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sabbath hovvre. I may novv with Dauid turne my ſpeech from men, vnto God. and ſay, <hi>It is time for thee Lord to worke, for they haue deſtroyed thy Law.</hi>

                     <p>Yet further I proue againſt them, that they haue aboliſhed the vvhole 4th Com. and that by their aboliſhing of the proper time in the 4th Comm. vvheras they ſay there are twoo things in the 4th Com. the one is the time, and this is aboliſhed; the other is the duties in the time, as reſt and holineſſe, and thes they hould Morall; if then I ſhall proue that thes duties, are nullified and aboliſhed then you vvill ſay vvith me, that they haue aboliſhed the 4th Com. indeed: for both the time, and the duties alſo vvill be aboliſhed. For this purpoſe we muſt know, that there are Sabbath day duties, and 4th Com. duties, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called; and there are duties very like vnto them; as one egg is like an other; but the like is not the ſame; or as a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait ſhilling is like a true and current ſhilling; but yet it is not a true ſhilling and paiable by the Kings authority: thus Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els Sacrificing, and Sauls Sacrificing, where alike, but Samuels Sacrificing, vvas properly a Sacrificing, Sauls was but an Apiſh imitation, and a counterfait: for he vvas not the perſon that ſhould doe it: So to reſt from laboure an vvholle day, and to ſanctifie it, in Holy proformances: this day being the 7th day, which is properly called Sabbath day, thus theſe duties, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called Sabbath day, and 4th Com. duties: but on the other ſide, to reſt an whole day, from labour, and to ſanctifie it by holy proformances, and this day not being the 7th day, but ſome other day: theſe dueties novv are very like the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as one egg to an other, as a counterfait, is to a currant ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? and as Sauls Sacrificing was to Samuels; but they are not the ſame duties, nor can they be properly called Sabbath day duties, nor 4th Com. duties; no more then a counterfait can be called a true ſhilling, or Sauls Sacrificing be counted Samuels Sacrificing; be cauſe this was not the day vvhereon theſe ſhold be done.</p>
                     <p>For example, the Iewes had yeerly Sabbathes; and weckly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21140:53"/>Sabbathes; now albeit the reſt, and the holy actions, done on the yeerly Sabbath day, vvere a like, and all one for kind, with thoſe done on the weekly Sabbath day, yet no man vvill ſay they were the weekly Sabbath day dueties, or the 4th Com. due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for they vvere done by virtue of an other ſpeciall Com. Againe the Iewes, had Sabbath dayes; and they had faſt dayes, and alſo dayes of publike thankſgiuing, as vve haue on Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Gunpovvder treaſon dayes and the like: Novv albeit they did reſt vpon theſe dayes, and performe like dueties, as vpon theire Sabbath day, yet no man will ſay theſe were Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day dueties properly, and 4th Com. dueties: I truſt no man thinketh that thoſe are Sabbath day duties, and 4th Com. dueties, vvhich vve doe on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day vvhen it falleth on a weeke day, or on <hi>Coronation</hi> day, and the like: no theſe are but like them: Thus it is for our Lords day, albeit we doe the like dueties on this day, which ought to be done on the Saturday Sabbath yet are they not the ſame: for they differ much, as 1. they differ in the day; thoſe vvere done on the 7th day, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periy called Sabbath day, and ſo Sabbath day dueties: theſe, on the 8th day, called Lords day, and ſo Lords day dueties: 2. thoſe vvere done in memory of the Creation; theſe in memory of the Redemption. 3. thoſe vvere done by the appointement of God in the Lavv; theſe, are ſuppoſed to be done, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt in the goſpell. 4. thoſe vvere done in imitation of God, at the Creation; who then reſted on the 7th day, and hallowed the 7th day, Geneſ. 2.2.3. But theſe dueties of Reſt and holineſſe on the Lords day, are not done in imitation of God at all, for it is the 8th day. Novv vvere there no more but the firſt difference, in that thes duties were done on a wrong day, it vvere enough to ſhevv that theſe are no Sabbath day dueties, nor 4th Com. dueties, no more then Sauls Sactificing was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels Sacrificing or a true and commanded Sacrificie: but all the 4. differences put together, it is manifeſt, that the dueties of reſt and holineſſe which we performe on the Lords day, are not Sabbath day dueties, nor 4th com. dueties, though they be neuer ſo like them: wherefore ſince thes be not the dueties comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the 4th com. which we performe, it followth that the proper
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21140:54"/>dueties of the 4th Com. are nullified and aboliſhed, as vvell as the time and day; and ſo the time, and the dueties in the time, being both aboliſhed, the whole 4th Com. is aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Thus hauing proued from their diſtinctiones, that they haue aboliſhed not onely the Lords Sabbaths, but alſo the 4th Com. it ſelfe: I am novv alſo to proue the ſame, from their obiections, vvherby ther profane abuſe of Scripture ſhall appeare, in that they ſo expound Scripture, as therby they ouerturne one of the Tenn Morall Lavves, the 4th Com. and by that time this be made apparant, I truſt all that loue God, vvill hate their doinges; and they that loue Gods Commandements, vvill contemne their Expoſitiones: for this purpoſe I vvill produce you two of ther ſtrongeſt and maine Textes, vvhence they collect their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections: the one is, Col. 2.16. <hi>Let no man condemne you in meate, or drink, or in reſpect of an holy day, or of the New Moone, or of the Sabbaths:</hi> vvhere by the word Sabbaths, they vvill needs vnderſtand the vveekly Sabbath commanded in the 4th Com. and ſo that ſhall be aboliſhed in this text, as a Shaddovv of Chriſt, The other Text is, Exod. 31.13. <hi>verily, my Sabbaths ye ſhall keepe, for it is a ſigne betweene me &amp; you, &amp;c.</hi> Where ſay they, the vveekly Sabbath, mentioned in the 4th comm. is made a Signe, and ſo it is aboliſhed. Novv from thes two textes and obiections of theirs, I gather two arguments as neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovving, for the vtter abolition of the 4th com.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is this, that if theſe two textes doe (as they ſay) abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh that very Sabbath day, vvhere of God ſpake in his 4th com. then are theſe vvords in the com. to vvit, <hi>the Sabbath day:</hi> a ceremony and aboliſhed: the reaſon of this conſequence is, becauſe theſe vvords Sabbath day, in their two textes, are in their nature the ſame, and of the ſame extent, vvith the like or ſame words (Sabbath day) in the 4th com. and it muſt be ſo, for they oppoſe thes words (Sabbath day) in their two textes, vnto the like vvords (Sabbath day) in the 4th com. the one to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the other. This being ſo, I proceed, if that theſe vvords in the 4th com, to vvit, Sabbath day, be a ceremony and aboliſhed, then is the 4th com. nullified, and vtterly ouerthrovvne: that this is ſo, I pray looke the text, Exod. 20.8. <hi>Remember (the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21140:54"/>day) to ſanctify it:</hi> I haue put the vvords in controuerſy, in a parentheſis as you ſee; novv let thes Miniſters take a way thoſe vvords in the parentheſis, and you take quiet avvay, the very ſubiect matter of the Lords ſpeech: you leaue a roofe with out a foundation: God ſaith, Remember the <hi>Sabbathday:</hi> but if now there be no <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> for that it is aboliſhed, as they ſay, hovv then ſhall a man Remember it? God commandeth to keepe the Sabbath day, Deut. 5.12. but if there be no Sabbath day, hovv ſhall a man keepe it? Againe, God ſaith, <hi>ſanctifie it:</hi> but how ſhall we ſanctify it, if it be not? vvhat can vve Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ſanctify a nothing? ſo thus I haue ſhown, that the very commandement, the 4th com. is vtterly nullified by their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectiones, and made to ſpeake non-ſenſe, or a nothing; this is my firſt argument.</p>
                     <p>My 2d argument, is taken from the vvord <hi>Sabbath</hi> in their owne ſenſe &amp; vſe of it; for when I vrge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the name Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in the 4th com. they turne me off vvith this, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew vvord Sabbath, ſignifieth a Reſt, in Engliſh: vvell be it ſo, a Reſt let it ſignify: from theſe two textes then, I argue againe, thus, <hi>If the Reſt in the 4th com. be aboliſhed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the 4th com. it ſelfe, vtterly aboliſhed: but that the Reſt in the 4th com. is aboliſhed;</hi> them ſelues confeſſe it in their obiected two Textes: for in thes Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, is the vvord Sabbath, ſee Exod. 31.13. Col. 2.16. vvhich vvord Sabbath ſignifieth a Reſt, novv they doe oppoſe the word Sabbath which ſignifieth a <hi>Reſt,</hi> in Exod. 31.13. Col. 2.16. againſt the ſame vvord Sabbath, in the 4th comm. which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a <hi>Reſt</hi> alſo, prouing vnto vs, that the Sabbath and Reſt in the 4th com. is a ſigne and a ſhaddovv, and ſo aboliſhed, by theſe Textes, Exod. 31. Col. 2. which being ſo, hence it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by their owne vvorke and ſenſe, that not onely the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brevv vvord Sabbath is an aboliſhed ceremony and ſhaddovv, but alſo that the Reſt vvhich it ſignifieth, is alſo a ceremony and an aboliſhed ſhaddovv. And ſo I come to proue the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, namely, that if the Reſt in the 4th com. be aboliſhed, then is the 4th com. vtterly and for euer aboliſhed: this I make good thus; if that Reſt from our ſeruile laboures, be aboliſhed, vvhich was once in the 4th com. commanded, then novv vve
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21140:55"/>may labour, in our calings, not onely on the ſixe dayes, but alſo on the 7th day; not onely on the vveeke dayes but alſo, on the Sabbath day; and if vve may on the Sabbath day, be occupied a broad the fieldes after our buſineſſes, this doth neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clud all neceſſity of aſſembling in the congregation, to pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and praiſe God togeather; for hovv can a man be both a broad and at home; in the field and in the Church; plovving there, and praying heere, both together?</p>
                     <p>Thus I haue finiſhed my arguments, raiſed out of their two Textes, vvherehy I haue proued, that from their obiections and expoſitions, there follovveth not onely an abolition of the Lords Sabbaths, but alſo a nullification of Gods 4th com. I muſt needs confeſſe, I can but wonder that there is any Sabbath day at all, kept in our Church, vvhen I conſider of thes common receiued diſtinctions, and obiections; for they doe directly ouerturne all force and virtue of the 4th com. for the keeping of any day at all as thence: and to goe about to raiſe a Sabbath day, out of the Nevv Teſtament is impoſſible, as ſhall be ſhovvne, vnleſſe ſome Nevv Scriptures can be found out, that be not now in our Bibles; wherefore conſidering theſe things, it muſt needs be a ſingular vvorke, and prouidence of God, to incline the hartes of our Church to giue God a Sabbath vnto this day: but it lyeth at the pittes brinke, and at the laſt gaſpe, the leaſt puſh of a profane minde, vvho ſpurneth at piety, would thruſt it in, and bury it for euer.</p>
                     <p>Thus much be ſpoken of this vſe, wherein I haue conuicted theſe Miniſters, of the vtter ouerthrow &amp; aboliſhing of the 4th com. and that partly by this, that they haue aboliſhed that day and time which is preſcribed in the 4th com. ſo that now we can not haue the commanded time, the Diuine time, nor that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified time; and as good therefore no time. But ſuppoſe we muſt haue a time, by force of conſequence, why then haue we for a Diuine time, appointed by God, an humane time, by man: and for a time ſanctified by God, we haue a profane time and vnſanctified: and yet for all this, this time is not a day, nor week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but an houre in a day, once in a mans life: or at the beſt, but a Lecture day for a Saabath day: thus much for the time. Now
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21140:55"/>as for the dueties in the time, either they haue vtterly aboliſhed them alſo, as hath bene ſhowne; or at the beſt they haue but counterfeit Sabbath dueties, for true Sabbath dueties: ſo much of the dueties. Laſtly, they haue as hath bene ſhowne, taken away the very ſubiect matter of the 4th comm. ſo as now God commandeth vs to Remember a nothing; and to ſanctify a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and ſo Gods commandement is made ridiculouſe. Loe, this foule errour, it is an errour, worthy the diſcouery; and high time it is that God ſhould raiſe vp ſome man to diſcouer theſe things, and to ſtand in defence of his 4th com. and for this cauſe, as I haue intitled my booke, a defence of the Lords Sabbaths; ſo haue I intitled it alſo a defence of the 4th com. for you ſee how they haue by blotting out the Lords Sabbaths, alſo defaced the whole commandement with them.</p>
                     <p>It is ſtrang to ſee, what violence this one finale portion of Scripture, to wit, Gods 4th com. hath vndergone: and it is the more ſtrang, conſidering the learning and knowledge of theſe times: what vaine &amp; friuolouſe diſtinctions, of a Sabbath &amp; the Sabbath, of one day in 7: of the Sabbath belonging to vs, as it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a Reſt: &amp; as it belongeth vnto all Nations: that the time is a ceremony, &amp; the duties in the time morall: by all which they exclud the proper time in this 4th com. and yet then againe to contradict themſelues; though the time of <hi>day</hi> be aboliſhed, yet ſtill they will haue the <hi>day,</hi> and a day out of the 4th com. and a day too of 24 houres long: and though the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, as they hold, yet they vvill haue a <hi>Sabbath</hi> day ſtill, &amp; out of the 4th com. too: The 10. commandements they call them the Morall Law: but bring them to this point, of the Sabbath day, and then they are become partly Morall, partly ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall; they might as well ſay, that that which in common ſpeech they call white, as the ſnovv, that it is partly white, partly blacke. The <hi>Papists</hi> are blamed for making the 2d com. Iewiſh and Ceremoniall; and yet ſay <hi>we</hi> this 4th Comm. touching the Sabbath day, is Iewiſh and Ceremoniall: thus hauing contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted our ſelues, then vve fall to botching and cobling of the Commandement; firſt it is fained that the Lords Sabbath day is aboliſhed, and vvorne out of vſe; and then to repaire the loſſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21140:56"/>and breach againe, that there may be a full number of ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, the 4th comman. wherein the breach vvas, muſt be cobled vp againe, the nevv leather where with all it muſt be amended, it is the Lords day, and it is put into the roome of the old and ouer vvorne Sabbath day: ſo we haue now, a new-old com. or an old-new com. whither you vvill; for it is partly old, and partly new. Laſtly, as if all the former were not enough, after ſondry contradictions; and after ſondry fine diſtinctions, whereby they haue violently torne a ſunder, what the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath inviolably and inſeperablie ioyned together, at laſt they caſt them all quite away, aboliſhing both <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>dueties</hi> in the time, and <hi>commandement</hi> &amp; all: thes, with others, which I might reckone vp, and with other violences and abuſes, which yet I am to diſcouer, hath this one ſmall portion of Scripture, the 4th com. vndergone: I cannot thinke, any one portion of Scripture, in controverſy betvvixt vs and Papiſts, hath bene more wreſted, and abuſed by them, then this by vs: God amend it. Paul telleth Timothy 1. Tim. 1.7. that there were ſome among them which <hi>deſiring to be teachers of the law, vnderſtood not what they ſaid, nor whereof they affirmed:</hi> This Scripture is verified of ſome Teachers in theſe dayes, as may appeare by the premiſſes; and as ſhall yet further appeare hereafter.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the word <hi>Remember,</hi> and touching this word, a reaſon may be demanded, why the Lord ſhould put a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum vnto this com. aboue any others of the 10? and why the Commandement, ſhould be expreſſed by this word Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? The common reaſon hereof rendered by diuins is, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent careleſnes and forgetfulneſſe on the ſix working dayes, of the Sabbath day, next enſuing; leaſt men ſhould leaue ſome common workes of the ſix dayes, to be done on the 7th day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: this I confeſſe a trueth indeed, but this is not all I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for, if one demandeth a reaſon, why God prefixed a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento to this Com. more then vnto any other of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, this cannot be the reaſon; becauſe that by mens not forethinking, of the Sabbath, ſome vvorkes are left vndone on the ſix dayes, to be done on the Sabbath day, and ſo the Sabbath is profaned, and the 4th com. tranſgreſſed: For, ſeeing that vve
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21140:56"/>are in like danger, of breaking euery other of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by a careleſnes and a not forethinking of our dueties in them enioyned, it ſhould haue bene needfull therefore, to haue had a Memorandum prefixed, vnto euery one of the 10. Com. as vvell as vnto this 4th com. leaſt we breake them alſo, through forgetfulneſſe: but ſince a Memorandum is put to this com. and not vnto others, ſuch a reaſon therefore would be ſought, as agreeth to this com. and not vnto others: Novv in this point, if I may take leaue, to deliuer mine opinion, I cannot finde out a better reaſon then this: God foreſeeing, that after a long time, that is, about 364 yeeres after Chriſt (for then was the Sabbath day aboliſhed, by the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Counſaile, as afterwards you ſhall heare more) this his Sabbath day, vvould be not in part violated, and profanely kept; but that it vvould be vtterly and altogether blotted out of remembrance, in all Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for 1200 yeeres together, as it is to this day; to preuent which forgetfulneſſe and vtter neglect of his Sabbath day, it pleaſed God, to prefixe a Memento to this com. that ſo, if it be forgotten, it might in time, by one meanes or other, be brought to remembrance againe, which God graunt.</p>
                     <p>If we take a ſuruey of all the 10 Com. we ſhall find, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing commanded in any of them, is ſo wholly and vtterly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and forgotten, as is the Sabbath day, commanded in the 4th com. vvhen they had buried Chriſt, they laid a ſtone vpon him, and ſealed it, to make all ſure, that he might neuer riſe againe; ſo haue they buried the Lords Sabbath day, and leaſt it riſe againe, they haue caſt an heape of ſtones vpon it, calling it Iewiſh, and Iudaiſme, and a ſigne and ſhaddow, and a buried aboliſhed ceremony, and vvhat not? and all to bring it out of remembrance: Now though Papiſts, haue foully forgotten the 2d com. yet all Proteſtants remember it well enough, God be thanked: I know not any one thing in all the 10. Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, forgotten by Reformed Churches, but this one thing onely, to vvit, the Lords Sabbath day: and as for this; this is forgotten of all, both Proteſtants and Papiſts: it was very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full therefore, that the Lord ſhould prefixe a Memorandum to this Comman. aboue and before all others, that ſo his Churches
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21140:57"/>might come into a remembrance of his Sabbath day againe.</p>
                     <p>The Lords Sabbaths are novv forgotten, they ley buried in abhorred forgetfulneſſe, like as a mans body, lieth ſtinking in the graue, God graunt them a ſpeedy and glorious reſurrection: they are forgotten, God of his mercy bring them once againe to remembrance. I am but a poore and meane one, euery way low and little, timorouſe by nature, ſtammering in toung, vnfitted for a buſineſſe of this nature, ſo as I durſt not aduenture vpon a buſineſſe of this conſequence, if by any other meanes or perſons, I could haue foreſeene any poſſibility of a reuiuing the Lords Sabbaths: but looking about, and ſeeing none that would ſet to his hands, but that ſtill the Lords Sabbaths muſt remaine in obliuion; I haue aboue and beyond my vvonted courage, (as it is vvell knovvne) taken vnto me a fiery zeale for the Lord of Hoaſtes; if it be raſhneſſe, I vvill be raſh: if it be folly, I vvill be a foole, vvith Dauid; if I periſh, I periſh: that ſmall mite, and ſingle Talent, vvherevvith all God hath be truſted me, I vvill improue it and imploy it, to the vtmoſt, for the reducing Gods Sabbaths, into remembrance againe, in his Churches: hitherto, in compariſon of this cauſe of Gods, I haue not counted deere vnto mee, Wife nor Children, Friends nor Country, mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance nor good name; but cheerfully in regard of the goodneſſe of the cauſe, haue parted with them all more or leſſe; I haue now nothing left, but life and liberty, and theſe I truſt, the ſame God that hath inabled me, will ſtill; I am in a readincſſe, to depart with theſe alſo or either of theſe, for God, and to ſeale vp his trueth with my liefe or liberty, that ſo I may once at length at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto that ioyfull Crowne of Martyrdome, for bringing Gods Sabbathes, into remembrance againe. <hi>Remember the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day.</hi>

                     <p>Yet further, if any ſhall obiect, that then we muſt keepe no holy dayes: if we muſt labour the 6 dayes: I anſwer it followeth not: for, 1. the com. addeth thes words, <hi>and doe all that thou haſt to doe,</hi> ſo that, if a man can ſo finiſh all his workes, that he hath to doe, in leſſe then 6 dayes, ſo as no vvorke be left to doe on the Sabbath day, then he may keep that time which he can ſpare, for an holy day. 2. it is true that ſome holy dayes, may be keept, as Chriſtmas day, Coronation day, Gunpovvder Treaſon day, and the like dayes of publike thankſgiuing, &amp; dayes of publike faſt, which are one day in a yeere, not a day euery week; for, we haue examples for it in Scripture, Eſther. 9.27, Joel. 2.15. now theſe being extraordinary caſes, an exception or diſpenſation may be admitted in the com: but whats this to our caſe? for, the Com. is to be vnderſtood of an ordinary weekly practiſe, when there is no iuſt and weyghty cauſe to the contrary: but the caſe of holy dayes, is of a rare and ſeldome action, and vpon extraordinary occaſiones.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond query ſhall be to knovv, which dayes thoſe are, vvherin God hath commanded vs to labour? the anſvver vvill be thoſe ſix dayes, vvhich were the firſt ſix dayes of the worlds creation; to vvit, thoſe ſix dayes vvhereof vve read, Geneſ. 1.5.8.13.19.23.31. the vvhich went immediatly before the firſt Sabbath day, that euer the vvorld ſaw, the Sabbath day vvheron God himſelfe reſted, where of vve read, Geneſ. 2.2.3. theſe ſixe dayes, are theſe: 1. Sunday. 2. Monday. 3. Tevvſday. 4. Wenſday. 5. Thurſday. 6. Friday. Novv that theſe and none other, are the ſix dayes, inioyned in the 4th com. is proued.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe elſe there would be a confuſion of Gods 7th day, wherin he reſted, vvith the other ſixe dayes; novv this muſt not be, for then God ſhall be defeated of his end and purpoſe, which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21140:58"/>vvas to haue the 7th day <hi>ſanctified,</hi> as appeareth by the 4th com. and that becauſe himſelfe reſted on it, Geneſ. 2.2.3. but if vve keepe not the dayes of the weeke diſtinct, it vvold come to paſſe, that vve ſhold worke ſomtimes, on that very day, wheron God reſted from vvorke, and vvhich God bleſſed and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for an Holy day. 2. The reaſon of the 4th com. Exod. 20.11. vvhich God dravveth from his ovvne example, is by vvay of ſimilitude, vrging vs to tread in Gods ſteppes, to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores, and follovvers of him, that is, to labour, vvhen God vvrought, and to reſt vvhen God reſted: novv if vve ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour on the 7th day, then ſlould vve not be like, but vnlike to God; for vve ſhould vvork vvhen God did reſt, ſo ſhould we not imitate God. Wherefore vve muſt chooſe thes ſix dayes, which vvent before the firſt 7th day, or Sabbath. 3. It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the conſtant practiſe of the Ievves vntill Chriſt; and by the Iewes now liuing at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and elſwhere, that the 4th com. vvas to be vnderſtood of thoſe very ſix dayes, vvhich vve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the firſt in the vvorlds creation, and vvhich goe before our Saturday: for the Ievves euer made, and ſtill doe make, theſe their ſix vvorking dayes, Sunday, Monday, Tewſday, Wednſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, Turſday, and Friday. Yea, ſince Sabbath day, is a proper name, and a ſtanding day, by it the other ſixe dayes may be knovvne. 4. It appeareth by the Nevv Teſtament, for euery vvhere, the day of Chriſts reſurrection is called the firſt day, of the vveek, Mat. 28.1. Mark. 16.2. novv the day of Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurtection is our Sunday, confeſſed by all ſides; ſo then our Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day is the firſt of thoſe ſix dayes, vvherin vve ought to labour by the com. and Friday then vvill be the laſt of our ſix labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring dayes: hauing thus fond out vvith dayes of the vveeke, we ought to labour in, vve come vnto vſes of the pointe.</p>
                     <p>Here I might inciſt, by way of confutation, of that errour of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Greenwood;</hi> vvho ſtifly defendeth it, that theſe vvordes in this 4th com. <hi>Sixe dayes thou ſhalt labour,</hi> &amp;c. they are no parte of the 4th com. but a parte of the 8th com. as if God had not knovvne hovv to place his commandementes, but had mingled ſome parte of the ſecond Table, vvith the things of the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and vvrote ſome parte of the 8th Com. in the 4th Com.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21140:59"/>either God hath miſplaced things, or M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Greenvvood hath miſtaken things; but ſuppoſing no other diuines will ſecond him, and that the bare mention of this abſurdety is enough to confute it, I paſſe on.</p>
                     <p>The firſt vſe of this point, is for the diſcouery of the errour of many, vvho being vrged by the 4th Com. to keepe the 7th day for the Sabbath: they anſwer, that Sunday, or the Lords day is the 7th day, to them: for they labour the ſix dayes which goe before the Sunday. To vvhom I reply, that albeit Sunday is the 7th day to them, yet is it not the 7th day to God: for that day, vvhich they count the 7th day, the ſame day, God euer counted for the firſt day; our Sunday, is the firſt day of the vveeke in a diuine accompt, not the 7 day &amp; laſt, as we haue proued: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vvhoſoeuer rekoneth Sunday for the 7th day, he follovveth an vnvvarrantable and humane account, and forſaketh the Scripture account, vvhich calleth Sunday, the firſt day of the vveeke conſtantly; now in diuine matters, vve muſt follovv a diuine accompt, and in Gods matters, vve muſt take Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: againe, whoſoeuer rekoneth Sunday for the 7th day, and therfore reſteth on Sunday, he doth not imitate God, in reſting vvhen he reſted, and in vvorking when he vvrought; according as is preſcribed in the 4th comm. but rather he croſſeth and thwarteth God, by reſting when God vvrought; and vvorking vvhen God reſted: for on our Sunday vve reſt, but on our Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day God vvrought; in that he began the firſt dayes vvork in the creation vpon our Sunday, making the light on this day, Geneſ. 1.4.5. againe, we croſſe God on our Saturday, for in it, we worke, but in it God reſted; yea, this day, God bleſſed it and ſanctified it for an holy day, Geneſ. 2.2.3. and yet this day vve profane it, and make it a working day. Thus it is plaine, that it is a foule errour in any to count our Sunday, or Lords day, the 7th day, and ſo a Sabbath or reſting day, when as it is one of the Six labouring dayes, and ſo a working day.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond vſe of this point, is for information: for if by the 4th Com. our ſix dayes, to wit, Sunday, Monday, Tewſday, Wenſday, Thurſday, and Friday, be thoſe ſix dayes, wherin we are to worke, after the example of God; then it follovveth,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21140:59"/>that no day of the weeke can be the Sabbath day, or Reſting day, but Saturday, the 7th day. This is to be noted againſt all thoſe, who by their vaine gloſſes, would expound the 4th com. ſo, as if ſome other day of the weeke, beſids Saturday, might be the Sabbath day by the 4th Com. now this cannot be, ſeeing God hath appointed all the dayes of the weeke beſids Saturday, for working dayes.</p>
                     <p>The third vſe of this point, is for confutation: is it ſo, that our Sunday, or Lords day, is by Gods com. a working day, it being one of the ſixe dayes, and the firſt of them; hovv vn ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed then are thoſe which goe about to ſet vp, and vphold the Sunday or Lords day, for a Sabbath day, and reſting day weekly? when God appointed it for a vvorking day, and alſo gaue it vs vnder his ovvne example; himſelfe vvorking on it, for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: neither can any anſvver, that this lavv, ſix dayes thou ſhalt labour: vvas a Ceremony and ſhaddow, and ſo aboliſhed by Chriſt: for there is no grownd for that in ſcripture: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is rather manifeſt, for what God did at the creation in vvorking on our Sunday, Chriſt our Sauiour ratefied at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; for being riſen from the dead; vpon our Sunday, the day of his reſurrection, he trauailed, and two of his diſciples alſo, a matter of 15 myles, Luk. 24.13. wherefore Sunday is a trauailing day, a working day, whother you reſpect Gods example, at the Creation; or Gods 4th Comm. vpon Mount Sinay; or Chriſts example and his Diſciples after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                     <p>But chiefly and principally, I mind to urge this vſe againſt ſome Miniſters, vvho doe againe notoriouſly abuſe this 4th com. by prouing out of it, an inſtitution for the Lords day, or Sunday, to be a Sabbath: thes men ſeeme for the time, to haue laid aſide both wit, and learning: are they not aſhamed, to goe about to vvreſt that Com. to ſpeake for, and command the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to be kept for a Sabbath and reſting day, the vvhich doth expreſly command the contrary? For, this branch of the com. <hi>Six dayes thou ſhalt labour.</hi> Doth command labour on the ſix dayes; Novv the firſt of thes ſix labouring dayes, is our Sunday or Lords day: novv vvas it euer heard before, that one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21140:60"/>ſhould command contrary things? or that one part of a commandement, ſhould command vs to labour, on the firſt day of the vveeke, and an other part of it, command vs, to reſt from labour on the ſame firſt day of the vveeke? is this to deale honeſtly and faithfully with the word of God in expounding it, to make it contradict it ſelfe; and that not in diuerſe places, but in one and the ſame text? I ſee it is not vvithout cauſe, that the Scriptures command people, to <hi>Trie all things,</hi> 1. Theſſal. 5.21. and ſo they had neede doe, leaſt they drinke in poiſon, in ſtead of an healthfull potion.</p>
                     <p>Thus I haue diſcouered an other ſhamefull abuſe of this 4th com. wherefore, vvhen hereafter you ſhall heare any of theſe, preach for the Lords day, and proue it to be a Sabbath day, out of the 4th com. then thinke of this vſe, collected from theſe vvords, <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour.</hi> Yea, when you heare them preſſe mens conſciences for the Lords day, to keepe it holy, and reſt from vvorke; becauſe the 4th Com. ſaith, Remember the Sabbath day: doe you then call to minde, that this day which they vrge ſo, it is not named Sabbath day, but Lords day or Sunday; novv the 4th com. ſaith not, Remember the Lords day &amp;c. but Remember the Sabbath day &amp;c. and further call to minde, that the 4th com. ſaith, Six dayes ſhalt thou vvorke: one of vvhich ſix dayes is the Lords day: Hovv then can theſe men vrge me to reſt vpon the Lords day, which is one of the 6 dayes, and that by the 4th com. vvhen the ſame com. biddeth me to labour on the Lords day, as being one of the ſix labouring dayes? Thus if people vvill be vviſe, thes Miniſters, if they will deceiue, they ſhall but deceiue themſelues.</p>

Deut. 5.14. in vvhich textes, the 7th day is deliuered in praeceptiue and commanding termes, prohibiting ſtraightly, the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it by vvorking, and that vpon paine of death &amp;c. In
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21140:60"/>this negatiue part of the Com. I vvill inciſt by vvay of expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, onely vpon the vvord <hi>ſeuenth:</hi> for the true ſenſe of this vvord, vve muſt note that there are two ſortes of numbers, a <hi>Cardinall,</hi> and an <hi>Ordinall:</hi> the Cardinall number runeth thus, one, tvvo, three, foure, fiue, ſix, ſeuen &amp;c. The Ordinall number runeth thus, the firſt, ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, third, fourth, fifth, ſixth, ſeuenth &amp;c. the due vnderſtanding vvhereof, bringeth much light to this point; as for the Cardinall number, be it foure, ſix, or ſeuen, it comprizeth all and euery one of the number; as all the fowre, all the ſix, all the ſeauen: but novv the ordinall number, it euer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth but one of the number, and that is euer the laſt of the number alſo; for example, The Third, it compriſeth not all the Three, but onely one of the Three: againe it ſignifieth not the ſecond, nor the firſt, but the third, vvhich is the laſt of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. 2. The fourth, it compriſeth not all the 4, but onely ſome one of the 4; againe it pointeth not to the ſecond, or third of the number, but to the fourth only, which is the laſt of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Novv to apply this, vve muſt knovv that this vvord in the 4th com. (ſeuenth) it is not a cardinall, but an ordinall number, the propertie vvhereof is to notifie one onely, and alſo the laſt of the number; vvherefore, vvhen the Lord ſaid, <hi>But the ſeuenth day is the Sabbath,</hi> &amp;c. hereby he gaue vs to vnderſtand, that he meant it of the laſt day of the weeke, and of the laſt day of that number, not of the third day, nor of the ſixth day, but of that vvhich is laſt of the number, to vvit, the Seuenth day. And if you vvould knovv vvhich day of our vveeke this 7th day is, ſee all the 4 Euangeliſts, calling the Lords day of reſurrection, which is our Sunday, the firſt day of the vveeke; if then our Sunday be the firſt day of the vveeke, then reckone onewards, and Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day vvill be this ſeuenth day; and alſo the laſt of the number.</p>
                     <p>Come we now vnto the vſes of the point, and firſt, is it ſo, that this 7th day, is commanded, and deliuered in preceptiue and commanding termes, as hath bene proued by ſondry textes of Scripture; then this bevvraieth the folly &amp; madneſſe of ſome Diuines, vvho ſeeing that here the Lord God doth ſo directly point at the Saturday for his Sabbath, as they haue no way to auoide it. Herevpon they fall to a blaſphemouſe deniall, ſaying,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21140:61"/>that theſe vvords, <hi>But the</hi> 7th <hi>day, is the Sabbath of the Lord, in it thou ſhalt not doe any worke,</hi> &amp;c. are no parte of the 4th com. and that they are nothing but appurtenances forſooth; thes men vvill take away no leſſe at once, then the Negatiue parte of a Com. they would haue no more in the 4th com. but thes words, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day, to ſanctify it.</hi> I might eaſily ſhew them, that thes words, Sabbath day, and ſeauenth day, are vſed promiſcuoſly, ſo as take avvay the one, and take away the other, graunt the one, and graunt both, ſee Exod. 20.11. Exod. 23.12. Luk. 13.14. yea, they be vſed both, to notify one &amp; the ſame day; like as Lords day, and Sunday, be both names for our firſt day of the weeke, ſo are Sabbath day, and, ſeauenth day, names for Saturday the laſt day of our weeke, if the one then belongs not vnto vs, no more doth the other; and if the one be a parte of the Com. ſo muſt be the other alſo.</p>
                     <p>But by theſe and the like euaſions, they vvill by hoocke or by kroocke, as vve ſay, by one bad means or an other, reiect the proper day, and time of the 4th Comm. and yet their very conſciences tell them, that the dueties of reſt and holineſſe, vvhich vvere commanded together vvith the time and day, &amp; in the ſelfe ſame com. doe belong vnto vs: novv vvhat an abſurd thing it is, for any to goe about to diuorſe, ſeparate, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne, thoſe things which God hath married as it were &amp; ioyned together? in the 4th Com. God ioyneth together the time, and the duties to be performed in the time: novv vvhat God hath ioyned together, let no man put aſſunder. They thinke the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties commanded to the Ievves, are deſcended to vs, but not the time, wherin thoſe duties were to be performed: this conceipt of theirs, is much like abſurd to theſe; as if an houſe ſhould deſcend to the heire, but not the grownd whereon it ſtands: or, as if a bond of 10<hi rend="sup">l</hi> paiable to the father vpon the 7th day of May; ſome Lawyers ſhould be of opinion that the ſome of mony in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to wit, the 10<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. is deſcended to his ſonne, after his deceaſe but not the time &amp; day of its payment, mentioned in the bond: or, where as our Sauiour taught the Iewes his Diſciples, in the 4th petition of his prayer, ſaying, <hi>giue vs this day our daily bread,</hi> to beg for two things, the one is <hi>bread,</hi> the other is the day, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21140:61"/>time when to haue it, to wite, <hi>this day:</hi> ſome Miniſters ſhould imagine that indede the petition concerning <hi>bread</hi> is Morall, and concerneth vs Chriſtian Gentiles; but for the day and time, that they vvould haue it <hi>this day,</hi> thats Ceremoniall, and belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged onely vnto thoſe Iewes the Diſciples of Chriſt, not vnto vs: iuſt thus, deale our Miniſters novv, vvith Gods 4th Comm. the dueties belong to vs, ſay they, but the time concernd the Iewes onely, not vs: neuer were there any Expoſitions more abſurd, then are our Expoſitions of the 4th Com. no, for abſurdety, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Ieſuites themſelues cannot out ſtripp vs: rather then faile, a parte of the Com. ſhall be denied too.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond vſe may be for confutation of ſuch Miniſters as will by one means or other, ſo falſly expound theſe vvords in the Negatiue parte of the Com. vvhich mention the 7th day, as they will make the people ſtrongly beleeue, that God meaneth the 8th day, or the firſt day: as if God had not knovvne hovv to ſpeake, but vvhen he nameth the 7th day, he meaneth the 8th day; vvhen he ſpeaketh of the 7th and laſt day of the vveeke, yet he meaneth the 8th or firſt day of the vveeke: who would think theſe to be faithfull expounders of Gods vvord? there are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; lights enough in the Com. as hath bene ſhovvn, wherby one that is but vvilling, may ſee vvhich day of the vveeke God meant. Neuertheleſſe, vvhatſoeuer can be ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, thes men vvil apply &amp; vrge this 4th com. hardly vpon mens conſciences for the 8th day, or Lords day; as if the 7th day, &amp; the 8th day were all one: may it not truly be ſaid of ſuch Miniſters, as once the Lord ſpake of thoſe prieſts, <hi>Her prieſts haue wreſted the Law,</hi> Zepha. 3.4.</p>
                     <p>This vſe may alſo be preſſed againſt the people, for ſuffering them ſelues to be thus deluded, &amp; blinded: it ſemeth they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue not the rule of the Apoſtle to <hi>Trie al things:</hi> nor the practiſe of the <hi>Bereanes,</hi> to ſerch the Scriptures, to ſee if the things be ſo, or not: but they handouer head, take all that is ſpoken for goſpell, if the Miniſter be an honeſt man, in their repute. As S. Paul ſaid, <hi>O ye foliſh Galatians, who hath bewiched you, that yee ſhould not obey the trueth?</hi> ſo may I ſay to many Engliſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; O foliſh Auditoures, who hath bevvitched you, that yee
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21140:62"/>ſhould not vnderſtand the trueth? doe yee not knovv the right hand from the lefte, the 7th day, from the 8th? the beginnig of the weeke from the end? vvil you ſuffer your ſelues ſo to be abuſed, that a Com. for the 7th day, you ſhould be brought to beleeue that it bindeth your conſciences, to the 8th day? finally it ſeemeth you chooſe rather to beleeue man then God; for God ſaith in expreſſe words, the 7th day is the Sabbath: but many Miniſters ſay, the 8th day is the Sabbath: novv vvhither of theſe tvvaine, you giue more credit vnto, your ſelues ſhall be Iudges.</p>
                     <p>I know well they think to ſalue vp the matter with a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a 7th &amp; the 7th: and ſo our 8th day, may be a 7th day, though not the 7th day. But we muſt know there is a <hi>Diuine</hi> accompt, and an <hi>humane</hi> accompt, now in diuine matters vve are to hould vs to a diuine &amp; ſcripture accompt, not to ſuch a one as vve may forge out of our ovvne braines, beginnig at what day of the weeke vve pleaſe for the firſt of our 7. Novv foraſmuch as God vſeth to begine at our Sunday or Lords day, for the firſt of the 7; both at the Creation, Geneſ. 1.5. and after the Redemption, Mat. 28.1. Mark. 16.2. Luk. 24.1. Ioh. 20.1. Act. 20.7. if vve vvill rekone the dayes of the weeke, as God rekoneth them, and beginne where he beginneth, vve muſt count our Sunday or Lords day, for the firſt day of the vveeke, or of the Seauen; vvhich being ſo, rekone forwards, and you cannot poſſiblie make, any day of the weeke the 7th, beſids Saturday: yea, Saturday is the 7th day, euen in Nature, for it is the 7th day from the Creation: yea, Saturday is alſo the 7th day, in a Chriſtian accompt, if you rekone from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; for Sunday or our Lords day, being the day of Chriſt his Reſurrection, vvherin he had finiſhed our Redemption, and this Lords day, being the firſt day of the vveeke in a Chriſtian account, for all <hi>Chriſtianes</hi> ſo counte it, &amp; ſo did the 4 <hi>Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> Mat. 28.1. Mark. 16.2. Luk. 24.1. Ioh. 20.1.19. count forvvards and Saturday muſt needs be the 7th day, to wit, the 7th day from the Redemption: ſo that Saturday is the 7th day euery vvay, both from the <hi>Creation,</hi> &amp; from the <hi>Redemption:</hi> wherfore, they vvho talke ſo of a 7th day, as if <hi>any day of the

                     <p>Some expound thes words, <hi>the ſeuenth day,</hi> to be meant thus <hi>one of ſeauen:</hi> ſome one day of the 7. but what is this better, or other, then to ſay <hi>a</hi> 7th? for both wayes they make Gods <hi>certaine</hi> time, to be <hi>vncertaine:</hi> for God ſpake of the 7th day, which is for certaine the laſt day of the number &amp; weeke, not of ſome one day or other vncertainely.</p>
                     <p>This one thing is to be noted, as a greate folly in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones of the Lords day, they vvill haue a Sabbath in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Redemption, as the Iewes had in memory of the Creation; &amp; this their new Sabbath alſo, that it may ſtand by the 4th Comm. it muſt be on a 7th day; &amp; yet they cannot tell vvhere to find a 7th day, in any <hi>diuine</hi> accompt for it, vnles it be Saturday, which they abhorre; &amp; therfore in roome of a 7th day, vvheron they tell vs, they haue at laſt lighted on a firſt day; are they not neere the matter think you? furthermore, they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr the 7th day from the Creation, for their nevv Sabbath; well then, I would gladly knovv of them, vvhence they vvould haue a 7th day; it muſt be either a 7th day from the Creation, or a 7th day from the Redemption; there is no third to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined: I knovv they vvill chooſe a 7th day from the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; vvell then, ſince Sunday or Lords day, is the day vvheron Chriſt roſe, and ſo the firſt day of Redemption, vvherin he brought light &amp; liefe into the vvorld; let them rekone onwards, &amp; Saturday (though it greeueth them) will be the 7th day, from the Redemption: wherefore, if they will be like them ſelues, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday muſt be their nevv Sabbath day, if they vvill keepe a 7th day from the Redemption, in remenbrance of it.</p>
                     <p>Saturday, is not onely the 7th day from the Creation, but alſo from the Redemption; vvherefore, vvhat day can be more fit for a nevv Sabbath, then Saturday? for it anſvvereth both to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21140:63"/>the Creation, &amp; to the Redemption, being the 7th day from both: hovv fitly then might the memory of both Creation, &amp; Redemption, be celebrated both together, vpon one day, to wit, Saturday euery vvay the 7th day?</p>
                     <p>To conclude, ſuppoſe vve, that Chriſt had left a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Lords day, in theſe vvords, <hi>Remember the Lords day to ſanctifie it, &amp;c. but the firſt day is the Lords day, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould not they be cenſured for corrupters &amp; wreſters of the Scriptures, who vvould attempt ſo to expound this firſt day, which is Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day or Lords day, as it might be vnderſtood of Monday the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day, vvhich is the day after? why iuſt ſo doe they novv deale vvith Gods 4th comm. it ſaith, <hi>Remember the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, &amp;c. but the ſeaueuth day, is the Sabbath day &amp;c.</hi> And yet they vvill make the 8th day, which is the day after, to be the Seauenth day: vvhy might not the ſecond day be vnderſtood, when Chriſt ſaid the firſt day, as vvell as the 8th day, vvhen God ſaid the 7th day?</p>

                     <p>The laſt thing in this 4th com. to be handled is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it in thes vvords, <hi>for in ſixe dayes the Lord made the heauen &amp; earth, the ſea, &amp; all that in them is, &amp; reſted the 7th day; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day, &amp; hallowed it,</hi> Exod. 20.11.</p>
                     <p>In theſe words, or in this reaſon to the com. theſe things are conſiderable, 1. That God bleſſed and hallowed the 7 h day. 2. The reaſon mouing God, to hallow it. 3. How theſe words, are a reaſon to the 4th comm. as for this third thing, it ſhall be handled in a Section by it ſelfe. For the firſt, that God ſanctified the 7th day, or Saturday Sabbath: ſee this plainely in this 4th com. <hi>Therefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</hi> Exod. 20.11. ſee it alſo Geneſ. 2.3. <hi>So God bleſſed the ſeuenth day, and ſanctified it.</hi> So then, this Saturday, 7th day, Sabbath, is a bleſſed and a ſanctified day: looke vvhat God hath bleſſed, it ſhall be bleſſed: and what God hath ſanctified, it muſt be holy; the <hi>Saturday,</hi> 7th day, Sabbath therefore, is an holy Time, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day. Thus <hi>Muſculus</hi> fol. 62. <hi>God might</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded onely the actes and doings of the day, but to ſet out the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21140:63"/>more pithilie, he ſaid, Remember that thou ſanctify the day of the Sabbath: He chargeth that the day it ſelfe ſhall be reputed holy.</hi> Where Muſculus doth not onely affirme, that the time and day was as well commanded, as thoſe dueties in the day, of reſt and holy exerciſes; but alſo ſaith, that the day it ſelfe is an holy day. Neither is this day holy, by any mans hallovving or ſanctifying of it, but by the proper worke of God himſelfe; for, ſaith theſe textes, the <hi>Lord</hi> bleſſed the Sabbath day, and ſanctified it: and, <hi>God</hi> bleſſed the 7th day, &amp; ſanctified it. Hereby we ſee, hovv God hath choſen out the Saturday for an holy day, aboue all dayes of the weeke; and God hauing made it an holy day, he hath thereby put as much difference betvvixt it, &amp; other dayes of the weeke, as vvas wont to be betwixt <hi>A Prieſt,</hi> &amp; a common man: the <hi>Temple,</hi> &amp; their common houſen: &amp; as is now betwixt <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall bread,</hi> &amp; common bread at our tables. Hence it is, that Saturday the 7th day, is called, the Sabbath of the Lord Exod. 20.10. and, the holy of the Lord, Iſa. 58.13. and, my holy day, Iſa. 58.13. and my Sabbath, Iſa. 56.4. How meanly ſoeuer times now count of this day, yet you ſee by theſe names, and Epithites, how God eſtemed of it.</p>
                     <p>I come to the ſecond thing conſiderable, which is the reaſon vvhich moued God, to hallovv this 7th day, Saturday, Sabbath: the reaſon then why God ſanctified this day, it vvas, <hi>becauſe</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had reſted on this day, from his great &amp; <hi>miraculouſe</hi> worke of the Worlds creation; ſee this moſt euidently Geneſ. 2.3. So God bleſſed the 7th day, &amp; ſanctified it, <hi>becauſe</hi> that in it, he had reſted from all his vvorke. You ſee one reaſon then, of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths inſtitution &amp; conſecration: thus A Kingdome, doth ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize the Coronation day, <hi>becauſe</hi> on that day the King came to his Crowne: men keepe their Birth dayes, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage dayes, <hi>becauſe</hi> on thoſe dayes they were borne, &amp; married: Thoſe Iewes Eſter. 9. kept the dayes of Purim, <hi>becauſe</hi> of their deliuerance from Hamans conſpiracy.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the vſes of theſe two points: and firſt, is it ſo, that therefore God ſanctified the Saturday, 7th day, Sabbath, becauſe that in it he had reſted from all his vvorke; why then ſay ſome men, it matters not which day, we giue God for a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21140:64"/>Sabbath, ſo be we giue him one &amp;c? Here was a reaſon you ſee, mouing God to ſet apart <hi>Saturday,</hi> rather then <hi>Sunday,</hi> or any other day, to wit, becauſe he had <hi>reſted</hi> on that day: and had God a reaſon mouing him to make a choiſe of dayes then, &amp; is there no reaſon at all now, but one day may be as meete as an other? hath length of time, worne this reaſon out of vſe? will any ſay, it matters not which day we keepe for Coronation day, birth day, or Marriage day? for Chriſts Paſſion day, reſurrection day, or aſcention day? Is there not ſome reaſon euen in thes, for one day aboue all others? euen ſo, is there not a reaſon, why the 7th day, ſhould be ſolemnized &amp; reſted on aboue all others, ſince that God ſolemnized it, &amp; reſted on it; and did therefore bleſſe it, &amp; <hi>ſanctify</hi> it, becauſe himſelfe had Reſted in it? I deſire this may be obſerued, by ſuch as expound the com. to be meant of <hi>one of ſeuen:</hi> that is, of one day of the 7, or of ſome one day of the 7 or other? as if God had made no choiſe, or difference of dayes; &amp; as if God had as well <hi>ſanctified</hi> Sunday, monday, tewſday &amp;c. and made them Holy dayes, as Saturday his ſacred day.</p>
                     <p>There are beſids others, theſe reaſons why we ſhould cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate this day, rather then any other, 1. becauſe on this day God reſted, and not on any of the other 6 dayes; &amp; vve muſt imitate God. 2. God hallovved and ſanctified this day, &amp; ſo he did not honour any other of the ſix dayes; but appointed them for worke. 3. God had ſpeciall reaſon to ſanctifie this day, becauſe himſelfe had reſted on it; but he had no reaſon ſo to ſanctifie any of the ſix dayes, for he reſted not on thos, but vvrought on them. 4. God commanded this day in ſpeciall to be ſanctified by his 4th comm. which vvere reaſon enough for vs to put a difference of dayes, if we had none other. We ſee then, it is a friuolouſe obiection, to ſay the leaſt of it, for men to ſay, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not ſo much, which day we giue God for his Sabbath, ſo be he hath one. God is in loue with his owne choiſe, no day can ſo pleaſe him, as his owne choſen day. The Iewes might as well haue ſaid, ſo be we offer Sacrifice in an houſe, &amp; by a man, it matters not which houſe, nor what man: yet God had choſen his <hi>Temple</hi> before all Houſen, &amp; his <hi>Prieſts</hi> aboue all men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they durſt not alter Gods choiſe. Might not we as well ſay
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21140:64"/>now, it matters not ſo much what man miniſtreth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo be a man doth it: nor what we drinke at the Lords Supper, ſo it be liquor? doe wee not abhorre ſuch obiections? If vve will keepe a Sabbath by the 4th com. vve muſt betake vs to ſuch a day onely, vnto vvhich this reaſon of the Sabbaths in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution mentioned in the 4th com. doth properly belong: it cannot be ſaid of any of the other 6 dayes Sunday, Monday, Tewſday, Wedneſday, Thurſday, or Friday, that God bleſſed or ſanctified any of them, becauſe he had Reſted on them: if therefore vve chooſe any of theſe 6 dayes, 1. vve keepe a day vvhich God did not bleſſe nor ſanctify for that end. 2. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate &amp; diſapoint God, of his maine reaſon &amp; end, vvhich mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to ordaine &amp; command the Sabbath, to bleſſe it and to ſanctify it; for, becauſe God had reſted on the 7th day, which is Saturday, <hi>Therefore</hi> the Lord bleſſed the 7th day, &amp; hallowed it, Geneſ. 2.2.3. I pray let this point be well obſerued, for it is of great conſequence.</p>
                     <p>Vſe 2. is it ſo, that God hath ſanctified &amp; <hi>hallowed,</hi> this 7th day, Saturday, Sabbath; hovv is it come about, that this ſacred time, is novv euery where in all Churches ſo ſtrangly profaned? for, as thoſe Iewes, dealt then with the <hi>Temple,</hi> they bought in it, &amp; ſould in it, &amp; changed their money in it, Mat. 21.12. So doe we now profane the <hi>Saturday Sabbath,</hi> by hauing markets there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by buying &amp; ſelling therein; yea, vve refuſe not to doe the moſt baſe, ſeruill, drudgery vvorkes, that the Kitchine hath, on the Lords Sabbath day: vve are farre vnlike our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the vſe of this day; he ſanctified it, we profane it; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on it, we worke on it; he commanded vs to Remember it, we forget it. Theſe things conſidered, it is high time for euery man, to make a ſerch &amp; inquiſition, to know whats become of the Lords Sabbath? and to be well informed of the reaſon. why the Lords Sabbaths are now forgotten, &amp; ſo ſtrangly profaned: The Prieſts lippes muſt preſerue knowledge, and people muſt ſeeke the law, at their mouths, Mal. 2.7. Wherefore I aduiſe people, to haue recourſe to their Miniſters in this matter, and in moſt ſeriouſe manner demand of them whats become of the Lords Sabbaths? &amp; by what warrant this ſacred time, is now ſo
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21140:65"/>profaned? and if they cannot for the preſent giue you a ſound reaſon, deſire them to take it into conſideration, &amp; to ſtudy the point better, that ſo a full ſatisfaction may be giuen to Gods people in this matter, or elſe a reformation may be ſought: it is no dallying; the matter is weightie; that a ſacred day, ſo hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by God, ſhould be now ſo profaned, it ſtandeth euery man vpon, to haue ſound arguments for it, vnleſſe he will be guilty of the ſinne of profaning Gods Sabbaths, weekly, and tranſgreſſion of the 4th com. &amp; ſleiting Gods example and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident.</p>
                     <p>This one thing I dare confidently auovvch, that no Miniſter is able to ſhew, any text of holy writ, which doth <hi>neceſſarily</hi> abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this 7th day Sabbath: as for thoſe textes Coloſſ. 2.16. Exod. 31.13. vvhich are their maine textes, thers no neceſſity at all in them, for abolition of the Morall Sabbath; for there be anſvvers enough to them, &amp; ſufficient enough, (as ſhall be ſeene hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when we come to anſvver to all their obiections) if thoſe that oppoſe God in his Sabbaths, did but <hi>pleaſe</hi> to retaine them, and to ſanctify them: I am confident therefore, that it is nothing but their meere willes, &amp; pleaſures, that makes them inueigh againſt the Lords Sabbaths: Let people therefore ſee to it, what manner of arguments &amp; reaſons, they admit of from their Miniſters, for their profaning of the Lords Sabbaths, which he hath <hi>hallowed</hi> &amp; <hi>ſanctified;</hi> let not euery trifling probable argument be auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, hauing but ſome liklihod to be ſo; but let them call for ſuch ſolid &amp; ſubſtantiall reaſons, as doe proue the aboliſhing of the Sabbath day neceſſarily, cleerly, &amp; vndeniably, to the full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of their conſciences; &amp; let Miniſters giue them no reaſons here, for their iuſtifiable profaning of the Lords hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Sabbath, but ſuch as will hould currant, before God, at the day of <hi>iudgement,</hi> when God ſhall call for an account of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred time, &amp; holy Sabbaths: neither let the people reſt ſatisfied, till they haue ſuch reaſons, for their profanation of the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied 7th day Sabbath, as they doe verily beleeue are ſound &amp; warrantable, &amp; ſuch as God will accept at their hands, vvhen they ſhall be queſtioned therefore, before his <hi>Tribunall:</hi> for no probable contingent, &amp; doubtfull arguments, will then paſſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21140:65"/>for current, againſt an expreſſe commandement, and ſo ancient &amp; ſacred an ordinance, as is Gods Sabbath. I conclud this point, with thoſe words of the voyce from heauen to Peter Act. 10.15. <hi>The things that God hath purified, pollute thou not.</hi> So ſay I to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, when your people repaire vnto you, for reaſons, to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy them in the profanation of the Lords ſacred &amp; holy Sabbaths; haue a care, leaſt you dravv all the guilt of Sabbath breaking, &amp; the ſinne of tranſgreſſion of the 4th com. vpon your owne ſoules, and that by your reaſons, you doe not pollute the things, which God hath ſanctified &amp; purified, the Lords Sabbaths I meane: the <hi>things that God hath ſanctified, pollute thou not.</hi>

                     <p>I come novv to the 3d thing conſiderable in the reaſon to the 4th com. mentioned in theſe vvords, <hi>For, in ſixe dayes the Lord made heauen &amp; earth, the ſea, &amp; all that in them is, &amp; reſted the 7th day: Therefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day, &amp; hallowed it.</hi> Theſe words <hi>ſixe dayes,</hi> you haue them tvviſe mentioned in this 4th com. the firſt time they are mentioned, is in Exod. 20.9. and there they are to be conſidered as a commandement: for they are deliuered in commanding termes. The ſecond time, you haue them mentioned, is in Exod. 20.11. and here they are to be conſidered as a reaſon: and ſo much is manifeſt by the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall particle <hi>(for)</hi> prefixed as you ſee. Wherefore novv vve are to conſider of theſe vvords, as they are a reaſon vrged by God, to induce vs to the Sanctifying of his Saturday, 7th day, Sabbath, commanded in this 4th comm. &amp; the reaſon is to be applied to the com. on this manner. 1. On the 7th day thou ſhalt reſt from thy labours; becauſe I the Lord thy God at the Creation, reſted from my worke on the ſame day, or on the 7th day. 2. On the ſixe dayes thou ſhalt labour &amp; finiſh all thy workes, ſo as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be left to be done on the 7th day: becauſe on the ſix dayes, I the Lord thy God did worke, &amp; finiſh all, leauing nothing to be done on the 7th or Sabbath day. Thus ſtands the reaſon, in relation to the com. as I conceiue it: as in the former part of the 4th comm. God preſſeth vs to the obſeruation of the Saturday Sabbath, by virtue of the 4th com. in commanding termes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Remember the Sabbath day, to ſanctify it, ſo in the latter
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21140:66"/>part thereof, God preſſeth vs to the obſeruation of the ſame day, by his owne <hi>example:</hi> ſo then, if either precept, or preſident will auaile with vs; if either an imperiouſe commandement, or a ſweete &amp; gentle reaſon will auaile any thing with vs, then vve muſt keepe Gods Saturday Sabbath: and ſuch with whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods commandement, no nor yet his patterne &amp; example propoſed for vs to follow, will preuaile, they ſhew themſelues not children of God, but rebelles to God.</p>
                     <p>God is pleaſed many times, in Scripture, to propound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for our patterne, as 1. Pet. 1.15. <hi>As he which hath called you, is holy, ſo be ye holy,</hi> &amp;c. Our Sauiour Chriſt exhorteth vs, to doe good to thoſe which harme vs, that ſo we may be the children of our heauenly father &amp;c. &amp; then he concludeth thus, <hi>you ſhall therefore be perfect, as your father which is in heauen, is perfect,</hi> Matth. 5.48. and ſo in this 4th com. God hath ſet forth himſelfe for our patterne, ſaying, Remember the Sabbath day, to ſanctify it; for I the Lord ſanctified it: on the 7th day, thou ſhalt reſt; for, on the 7th day, I the Lord reſted: if therefore you will be led by reaſons, as reaſonable men ſhold, then let Gods reaſon take place with you; or if you vvill be led by examples, let Gods example be of force vvith you, to keepe his Saturday Sabbath: Wherefore laying aſide Gods commandement, I now vrge onely Gods reaſon vpon you; and Gods example vpon you; exhorting you in the vvords of the Apoſtle, <hi>Be yee therefore followers of God, as deere children,</hi> Eph. 5.1. Hee kept the Sabbath day, doe you ſo too. But if yet you ſhall enquire which is the day? I anſvver, ſee but vvhich day of the vveeke it vvas, on vvhich God reſted at the Creation, Geneſ. 2.2.3. &amp; that is the day vvhich God perſvvadeth vs to keepe: elſe it vvere imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, for God to perſvvade vs to keepe the 8th or 9th day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he kept the 7th day. The premiſſes &amp; the concluſion, muſt be vnderſtood of the ſame thing, as Logiceans know well; the 7th day, therefore is the day, to vvit, the 7th day from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vvhich is Saturday; for on this day God reſted, and to this day God perſvvaded vs.</p>
                     <p>The vſe of this point is for the iuſt reproofe of our times, vvith vvhom neither precept, nor preſident vvill preuaile; for,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21140:66"/>neither Gods commandement, nor Gods example, can doe any thing now a dayes, no nor yet Gods reaſons can moue any whit; if any of theſe 3, or if all of them together, would take place with vs, behold, vve haue them all in this 4th com. For 1. God commanded the Sabbath day. 2. God kept it himſelfe. 3. He allureth vs by a ſtrong reaſon, taken from his enſample, &amp; noted by the particle <hi>for.</hi> How could a point be more thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſed? of all ſortes of people, vvhich come vnder this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, I find none more guilty, then ſome of the Clergie; for as for the Laity, though they be guilty hereof, yet a little matter would ſoone reclaime them, but as for theſe of the Clergie, they are intoxicated, and euen drunken with reaſon &amp; Sophiſtry; for Gods reaſon, which he vſeth here in this com. to allure men to keepe his Sabbaths, it is vvith them as no reaſon; for, either they will make this reaſon, no parte of Gods comman. or but as ſome needleſſe appendix vnto it; or let it ſtand ſtill for a cipher, as no reaſon at all; &amp; ſo they make a ſhevv to imbrace Gods 4th com. but not his reaſon which hee added to the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement; it is the property of an vnreaſonable man, to reiect Gods rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Or elſe, by their ſubtill vſe of reaſon, they can toſſe it, as a man doth a Tennis bale, from one day, vnto another, as if the <hi>reaſon</hi> muſt runne thus; Therefore God bleſſed &amp; ſanctified the 7th day, becauſe vve ſhould keepe the 8th day: therefore God hallowed the Sabbath day, becauſe we ſhould ſanctifie the Lords day. As abſurd as it is, for the concluſion to be vnderſtood of one day, &amp; the premiſſes of an other, yet can they put ſome cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler or other on it, whereby the ſimple, yea &amp; themſelues too, are deceiued: and this deceipt is the more dangerouſe, in that it is cullered ouer vvith a ſhevv of learning; common people verily beleeue, that becauſe they are ſo learned &amp; conſcionable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they vſe their learning &amp; conſcience in euery matter they medle withall; I wiſh it were ſo; Oh that <hi>Lot, Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> had alwayes vſed that knowledge &amp; conſcience, that was in them?</p>
                     <p>Were it the common people that violated Gods Sabbathes, vve could ſoone check them with the 4th com. &amp; with the example, &amp; <hi>reaſon</hi> of Almightie God, to the contrary: but novv
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21140:67"/>ſince it is the ſyne of Miniſters, no bonds, nor reaſons of God, can hould them; for they haue fond out ſo many diſtinctions, &amp; anſwers, &amp; obiectiones, as they can both violate &amp; profane the Sabbath day; &amp; yet againe make God &amp; man beleeue, that they keepe the Sabbath day; as you ſee none cale more for it then they, witneſſe their Sermons; ſo theſe can profane Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathes, with a grace; they can doe it, &amp; defend it when they haue done; they can doe it &amp; neuer bluſh at it: theſe therfore are in a moſt dangerouſe, &amp; well nigh deſperate caſe, ſmale hope of repentance. This one thing I demand of them, let them put all their lerning, &amp; all their honeſtie together, &amp; try, if by them both, they can tell hovv to apply this <hi>example</hi> &amp; <hi>reaſon,</hi> which God addeth here to this 7th day Sabbath, vnto their 8th day, &amp; Lords day Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>God hath vrged his Sabbaths 1. with a Memorandum prefixed to them, more then to any other thing Commanded. 2. with a Commandement. 3. with his owne example. 4. with a ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. what may be the reaſon, why theſe Clerkes profeſſing to be Maſters of reaſon &amp; Artes, ſhould not ſee or acknowledge theſe moſt reaſonable things? or ſhould ſo foully miſapply them, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly we haue ſhovvne they doe? It cannot be the difficulty of the point, for thats eaſy &amp; familiar: nor can it be the ſtrength of Scriptures, againſt the Lords Sabbaths, for the aboliſhing them; for they haue none neceſſarily prouing that point: nor can it be the ſtrength of Scriptures for the alteration of the day, for they haue none to that purpoſe neither: wherefore it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the eyes of their <hi>reaſon,</hi> are blinded with ſome ſiniſter &amp; by <hi>reſpects</hi> or other: I will propound ſome, &amp; let their owne hartes iudge whither I haue hit the marke or not.</p>
                     <p>Many looke vpon the antiquity of the pointe rather then vpon Gods Commandement; verely beleeuing, the aboliſhing of the 7th day Sabbath, &amp; the erecting of the Lords day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, cannot poſſible be an errour, it is ſo auncient; as if errour could no be ancient.</p>
                     <p>Many looke vpon the vniuerſality of the point, (an other Popiſh argument) verily beleeuing, it cannot poſſibly be an errour, vvhich is ſo vniuerſally receiued, eſpetially many of them being religiouſe &amp; Godly men: as if a Godly man could not erre.</p>

                     <p> Many looke vpon the learning, of ſuch as haue profeſſed it, (an other Popiſh argument) as if lerned men could not erre. Thus, they that looke aſquint, at thes by reſpectes, when they goe to iudg of the caſe in queſtion, rather then at thoſe 4 maine things euen novv propounded to be conſidered in Gods 4th Com. it is no maruaile they cannot ſee the vvood for Trees.</p>
                     <p>Many looke before they will reade my booke, or ſcane the point, at the vtter impoſſibility of any reformation; (as if our dayes vvere vvorſe then euer were any before) &amp; therfore they haue no mind to vnderſtand it; thus they looke vpon Gods matters vvith carnall eyes; vvho, in other caſes teach men to doe their duety &amp; leaue the ſucceſſe to God: ſhould all men treade their ſteppes, they would make all ſure againſt any reformation, ſince they vvill receiue no information.</p>
                     <p>Some are of opinion, that God will vvincke at vs, as he did at the Patriarks hauing many vviues; ſince it is the practiſe of all Churches, to doe as we doe; &amp; therfore they vvill goe on, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſſe of any further knowledge of the point: But ſuch men may liue in adultery at this day, vpon the ſame growndleſſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, if but many others would conſent &amp; ioyne vvith them in this wicked practiſe, ſo as they might but haue this plea, that all men doe ſo, or that all Curches doe ſo. (I would not be thought to ſpeake at rouers, &amp; to gueſſe only in theſe obiections &amp; by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes, at what men may think; for theſe myne eares haue heard men make the moſt of theſe obiections which here I propound.)</p>

                     <p>Many thinke, what ſhall I learne? what I that haue thaught others? &amp; novv in myne old age? it is better to hould this for an errour, &amp; ſo to reiect all thoughts of it: but I ſhould eſteme that man not worthy to teach others, vvho ſcorneth to learne of others.</p>
                     <p>Many thinke, if they ſhould giue any way to the knovvledge of this point, they ſhould but diſturb the peace of the Church, &amp; vve are novv at a ſwete concord; it is better therfore to be ignorant of it, &amp;c. But by this reaſon, vve might haue remained all Papiſts vnto this day; for had our forefathers, vpon this grownd reiected Luthers doctrine, had vve not all bene deeply guilty ſtill, of the ſyne &amp; breach of the ſecond Com. &amp; Popiſh Idolatry? yea, &amp; what I pray is this better, then groſſe tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, &amp; pleaſing of the times?</p>
                     <p>Many thinke, poſſibly it may come to paſſe, that the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this point, may coſt them loſſe or hazard of their liuings, wherby they are now comfortable maintained; &amp; therfore it is good, not to be firſt in the knovvledge &amp; profeſſion hereof; they think they may know it ſoone enough 10 or 20 yeeres hence to their coſt, let others breake the yee in the meane time. But theſe men ſet more by a good liuing, then by a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: they loue to ſerue God, but it ſhall be no further, then they may ſerue theire owne turnes: they will ſerue God, if they be ſuer once, it will coſt them nothing.</p>

                     <p>Before I conclud this ſection, one thing more I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your conſideration, &amp; this it is; vvheras this 4th com. generally conſidered, hath two partes; the one is the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement it ſelfe; the other is the reaſon of the commandement: as formerly I haue ſhowne you, that our Miniſters haue by their renovvncing of the time in the Com. renownced &amp; aboliſhed,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21140:69"/>by iuſt conſequence, the whole 4th com. alſo: ſo much I am to diſcouer a further errour of theirs, which is, that by their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of the time in 4th com. to wit, the Saturday, 7th day, Sabbath; hereby alſo they haue nullified, &amp; aboliſhed, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the com. which is taken from Gods owne example, and conteined in theſe words, <hi>For in ſixe dayes the Lord made the heauen &amp; the earth, the ſea, &amp; all that in them is, &amp; rested the 7th day: Therefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day, &amp; hallowed it.</hi> All theſe words I ſay, they haue vtterly nullified, ſo as now they ſtand but for a cipher, to fill vp an empty place. What I haue charged them with, I thus make good: The <hi>argutum</hi> &amp; thing which God would perſvvade his people vnto, it is the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; ſanctification of the 7th day Sabbath, as you may ſee in the com. foregoeing this reaſon; to this end it pleaſeth God, to frame &amp; propound vnto vs, a moſt notable, &amp; liuely reaſon, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his owne example, to this effect, Remember you to ſanctifie the Sabbath day; for becauſe I ſanctified the Sabbath day: Doe you reſt from vvorke on the 7th day; for becauſe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted from worke on the 7th day: &amp; therefore I hallowed &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified the 7th day Sabbath. Now ſuppoſe we, that the 7th day Sabbath were aboliſhed, as they ſay it is, which is the <hi>argutum</hi> or thing argued, wherevnto God did by this reaſon perſwade, then what vſe can there be of this reaſon, which God here propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth? for example, now that Circumciſion, the Paſſeouer, &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices are ceaſed, what vſe is there now of thoſe reaſons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Gods people the Iewes, were then perſwaded to thoſe due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Circumciſion, the Paſſeouer, &amp; Sacrifices? ſuch is the caſe here, take away the Sabbath day, &amp; you take away the reaſons that belonged to it, to perſwade vnto the ſanctification thereof: for what need reaſons &amp; motiues, to perſwad vnto that which is not?</p>
                     <p>But happily they will ſay (though vntruely) that the Sabbath day is not aboliſhed, it is only but changed vnto the Lords day. Well, ſay we for this time grant them this for argument ſake: then thus I make it good againſt them; the reaſon of the 4th comm. cannot poſſible be a reaſon vnto the Lords day, for it is moſt abſurd for any man to thinke, God ſhould perſwade vs to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21140:70"/>keepe the <hi>Lords day,</hi> becauſe hee kept the <hi>Sabbath day:</hi> or that God ſhould perſwade vs, to keepe the <hi>firſt</hi> day of the weeke, becauſe kept the 7th &amp; <hi>laſt</hi> day of the weeke: Thus the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, &amp; the premiſſes ſhould not be of the ſame, but of ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things: For, the day vvhereof the queſtion is, as novv they would haue it, to vvit, the Lords day, it differeth much from the day mentioned in the reaſon to the com. &amp; that thus, 1. The day in the reaſon, God reſted in it, but the day in the queſtion, God vvrought in it. 2. The day in the reaſon, God ſanctified it, and hallovved it, but the day in their queſtion, to vvit, the Lords day, vve no vvhere reade that God bleſſed it, &amp; ſanctified it: ſo the one differeth from the other, as much as an hallovved, or holy day, doth from an vnhallovved, or vvorking day. If it be ſo then, that this reaſon propoſed by God, cannot be applied vnto the Lords day, then it follovveth, that this reaſon, is made by ſuch as oppoſe the Lords Sabbaths, a very cipher, &amp; of none vſe, but to fill vp a voide place. A very vvicked fact it is, vvhoſoeuer are guilty of it.</p>
                     <p>Yet further, that this reaſon ſtands now a dayes (ſince our Lords day is come into vſe, and the Sabbath day aboliſhed) as a meere cipher; it vvill further appeare, if you doe but take a ſuru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When did you heare any ſay, it is your duety, to ſanctify the Sabbath day, we now keepe; becauſe on it, God Almightie reſted from his worke? and, it is your duetie to keepe this Sabbath day, becauſe God did at the Creation, bleſſe it, and ſanctify it? No, if they ſhould vſe theſe reaſons, their davvbing vvould be ſeene into; euery man can tell them, this Day that vve keepe, is not the day wherein God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, but the day vvhere, in he vvrought; and this day, is not the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21140:70"/>it hath ſtood for a Cipher, this many hundreth of yeeres: me thinketh the conſideration but of this one point, ſhould be enough to certify them that they are wrong, for aſmuch as they dare not preſſe this Sabbath we novv keepe, vvith Gods reaſon, annexed to his 4th Comm. now of all reaſons that men can inuent, what reaſon more forcible then that, which is taken from Gods owne <hi>example,</hi> that he reſted on that day, &amp; ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it: but now this argument from the example of God, is ſtale in the Churches, is quite out of vſe; vvho doth excite &amp; ſtirre vs vp, in thes our dayes, from the example of God, ſaying, let vs keepe the Sabbath day, for God Almightie kept it? let vs reſt from our laboures on the Lords day, becauſe God reſted from his workes on this day? let vs ſanctifie &amp; hallovv the Lords day, becauſe God Sanctified &amp; hallowed it, at the Creation, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ. 2.2.3. let vs keepe the Sabbath day, an Holly day? for God made it an Holly day, by hallowing it, Exod. 20.11. Geneſ. 2.2.3? Let vs honour it, as the moſt auncient holly day, it being as auncient as the world, Geneſ. 2.2.3? &amp; as the moſt honourable holly day, it being made an holy day, by God himſelfe, &amp; not by man, Geneſ. 2.2.3. all men follow the example of the king; &amp; who would not follow this example of God, the king of kings, if it were vrged? if therfore the Lords Sabbaths, be neglected, for want of forcible &amp; moſt preualent argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; reaſons, let ſuch Miniſters beare the blame, who depriue the people of this ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall &amp; mouing an argument: what a maruailouſe thing is it, that God ſhould in his wiſedome &amp; goodneſſe to vs, beſids his Com. perſwade vs by ſuch mouing &amp; powerfull reaſons, as he hath annexed to his Com. &amp; yet Miniſters are Mute &amp; ſilent, as if ther were no ſuch things in the Law &amp; word of God: is it not meete, that ſuch af oule errour as this is, ſhould be diſcouered?</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe that ſome haue Sophiſtically, by playing with the Homonymie of the word Sabbath, improperly applied to our Lords day, both deceiued themſelues &amp; others, &amp; ſo vrged a farre off this reaſon vpon our day, ſurly they haue toucht it, but lightly, as glad when they are ſafely got off it againe, leaſt they ſhould bewray all: for example, ſuppoſe a man that knowes the difference betwixt the day called Sabbath day, in ſcripture; and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21140:71"/>the day called Lords day: the one being the 7th &amp; laſt day of the weeke, the other, the firſt day of the weeke: the one, being the day before the other; the one being for memory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the other for memory of the Redemption: if now a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould tell him, it is his dutie to ſanctify the Lords day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God ſanctified the Sabbath day; would not the man think the Miniſter ieſteth vvith him? ſince he knowes God ſanctified the 7th day of the weeke, but our Lords day, is the 8th day, or firſt day of the weeke? &amp; ſince he knowes that the reaſon which he vſeth, ſpeakes of the day named Sabbath day, but the day he applieth this reaſon vnto, it is of another name, to wit, the Lords day? vvould he not thinke the Miniſter hath foully miſtaken himſelfe, to miſapply ſo the example of God, to a wrong day? for, if the Miniſter would preſſe a man, to ſanctify the Lords day, from the example of God, he muſt bring an example where God reſted on the Lords day; and where God bleſſed &amp; ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Lords day. Wherfore, to conclud this point, either they are a ſhamed of Gods reaſon, &amp; dare not vſe it at all; or if they doe, they muſt play the egregiouſe Sophiſters vvith the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opſe, by playing with the Homonymie of the vvord Sabbath, vſeing it in an other ſenſe, then it is vſed by God, thereby to couer their doubling, from the eyes of the people; but for the moſt parte of them I am ſuer, they vſe not this reaſon at all, &amp; theſe doe leſſe euill, then thoſe which abuſe it.</p>
                     <p>Thus then you ſee, they haue firſt aboliſhed the whole 4th Commandement, as elſvvhere I haue proued; &amp; here againe you ſee they haue aboliſhed the reaſon to the Com. &amp; Gods example: now then let vs put them together, &amp; then the totall ſome vvill be, that they haue by aboliſhing the <hi>Time</hi> in the 4th Com. aboliſhed alſo the vvholl Commandement: &amp; not onely that but alſo the <hi>reaſon</hi> &amp; <hi>example</hi> of God, annexed to the Com. &amp; ſo they haue made cleere vvorke; for they haue taken away all, euen all, roote &amp; branch.

Exod. 31.13. and for theſe words, (theſe 7th day, is the Sabbath) this is that vvhich of all other partes of the commandement: they abhorre, as a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſh ceremony; ſo much for the commandement: come we next vnto the reaſon of the com. noted by the vvord for; vvhich con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth a moſt effectuall perſvvaſion from Gods ovvne example: &amp; herin theſe vvords (reſted the 7th day) doe ſtand for a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher; no Miniſter at any tyme in theſe our dayes, vſeing thes vvords, as a reaſon to moue and excite vs, to reſt on the 7th, or 8th day, becauſe God reſted at that time: ſecondly, theſe vvords (the Sabbath day) doe ſtand for a Cipher alſo; for no Miniſter doth perſwade vs in theſe dayes, to ſanctify the Sabbath day, becauſe God ſanctified the Sabbath day, to vvit, the Saturday Sabbath: for it is the Saturday vvhich God hallovved &amp; ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at the Creation.</p>

                     <p>Furthermore, the indignity offred vnto this com. is ſuch, as it is not now onely ſhamefull to looke vpon; but alſo it is by their corrupt expoſition, made very non-ſenſe &amp; ridiculouſe; to this purpoſe, let vs collect together ſo much of this comm. as they allovv to be memorall, and omit that vvhich they make ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall, that is, ſo much as is put within the halfe moone cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, &amp; ſee what a peece of ſenſeleſſe ſtufe there will be: and this then it is; <hi>Remember to keepe holy. Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour, &amp; doe all thy worke: But, of the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt not doe any worke, thou, nor thy ſonne, nor thy daughter &amp;c.</hi> ſee if by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions &amp; ſubtilties, they haue not picked out the heart, and ſenſe of this com. by picking out the time. Thus for the comm. but further, for the reaſon which God hath annexed to his com. taken from his reſting on the 7th day; and, from his ſanctifying and hallowing of the 7th day: this reaſon I ſay, hath not onely ſome vvords pickt out of it, as had the com. but vvhich is more, the vvholl reaſon it ſelfe, as God laid it dovvne, &amp; vvrote it in Tables of ſtone, is vtterly by them aboliſhed &amp; vſeleſſe; no mention of it in theſe our dayes, thereby to excite &amp; perſvvad people to the obedience of the 4th com. Wherefore, by your eye ſight, you may behold the abuſe of this comm. and by your obſeruation, you may take notice, how the reaſon to the com. is nullified; two remarkable things to be obſerued.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of theſe things (me thinke) ſhould plead ſtrongly againſt all the enemies to the Lords Sabbaths, that ſo all their reaſons they bring againſt them, ſhould be ſuſpected &amp;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21140:74"/>reiected; becauſe by their aboliſhing his Sabbaths, they muſt needes make ſuch hauocke of Gods 4th com. as you ſee: Their textes of Scripture alſo Col. 2.16.17. and Exod. 31.13. with the reſt, are to be ſuſpected as corrupted &amp; groſly abuſed by them, ſeeing that they vvill ſo vrge &amp; preſſe them, againſt the 7th day Sabbath in the 4th com. as that by one text of Scripture, they will mangle another; &amp; ſo vnderſtand one text of Scripture, as it ſhall eate out the very bowels of an other; ſo ſetting Scripture againſt Scripture; the text Col. 2.16. ſhall eat out the bowels of the 4th com. yea this text Col. 2.16. with other the like, &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reaſons they haue, ſhall picke out the very heart &amp; ſenſe of the 4th com. &amp; make it ſenſeleſſe, as you ſee: of like nature are all their diſtinctions, &amp; therefore worthily to be abhorred, of all ſuch as loue Gods lawes: God will vndoubtedly one day, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe all ſuch diſtinctions, &amp; expoſitions of any text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as are made in oppoſition to his Lawes: is there no way to expound the Goſpell, but ſo as it muſt needs quite ouerturne the law, or ſome part of it? and is it meete to receiue ſuch vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary diſtinctions, as ſhall rend out, &amp; raſe out ſome portion of Gods law, the Decalogue or 10 Com. I meane?</p>
                     <p>But it may be obiected, that vve doe not make ſuch hauocke with the 4th com. nor make it ſo voide &amp; ſenſeleſſe, but that we doe ſtill retaine it, &amp; doe preſſe it vpon mens conſciences, vvell nigh euery ſermon &amp;c. True indeed, you vrge the 4th com. but how abſurdly, let all men iudge; like as if a man ſhould cancell a bond, &amp; plucke off the ſeales, &amp; yet ſtifly plead his bond ſtill; ſo theſe, after by their doctrine they haue made the comman. a peece of ſenſeleſe &amp; ridiculouſe ſtuffe; yet ſtill they call and cry out the 4th com. the 4th com. yee tranſgreſſe Gods 4th com. Furthermore, the reaſon annexed to it by God, as moſt effectuall to perſwade men to obedience of this com. taken from Gods en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſample, this you altogether omit &amp; neglect: For, when are you heard to perſwade the people thus? Let vs reſt from our workes on the Lords day, becauſe God reſted on the 7th day, Gen. 2.2. Exod. 20.11? Let vs ſanctifie the Lords day, becauſe God ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified &amp; hallowed the 7th day, Gen. 2.3. Exod. 20.11? Let vs be imitators &amp; followers of God, as deere children, and keepe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21140:75"/>that day vveekly for an holy day, vvhich God himſelfe made &amp; kept an holy day, at the Creation? No, no ſuch matter, for ſo they ſhould contradict themſelues: If they ſhould perſvvad men to follovv Gods example, ſo the myſterie of their iniquity, vvould be diſcouered: for God kept the 7th day, from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but our Lords day, is the 8th day from the creation: &amp; the day vvhich God kept, vvas kept in memory of the Creation; but our Lords day, is kept in memory of the Redemption: thus as the com. is nullified, ſo the reaſon to the com. is made a meere ſuperfluouſe cipher, &amp; altogether vſeleſſe, let them ſay what they vvill to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>As for the law it ſelfe, you vrge it indeed vpon mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, but vvith ſmall conſcience you vrge it; for you abuſe &amp; prefane Gods word (as hath bene ſhowne) by applying that to the Lords day, which is a common vvorking day, as fryday is; vvhich ſhould be applied by Gods ordinance, to an holy day, vvhich himſelfe had hallovved, as to the 7th day; as well might you profanely apply thoſe Sacramentall vvords of inſtitution, to common bread, &amp; to common water, as Gods 4th comm. to a common day, not ſanctified by God. And thus much for Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the 4th Commandement.</p>
                     <p>THus I haue endeavoured to make it appeare, hovv they haue corrupted &amp; abuſed the lavv, and thereby corrupted &amp; abuſed the people alſo: What remaineth, but that they may be driuen to <hi>repentance,</hi> I minde them of that fearefull denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, vttered by our Sauiour Chriſt, after that he had ratified the <hi>law,</hi> in the integrity &amp; perfection of partes, euen to a <hi>iot</hi> &amp; <hi>title</hi> of it, Mat. 5.18. Whereto he addeth theſe words, <hi>Whoſoeuer therfore ſhall breake one of theſe leaſt Commandements, &amp; teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdome of heauen: but whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhall obſerue, &amp; teach them, the ſame ſhall be called great in the Kingdome of heauen,</hi> Matth. 5.19. In which words, our bleſſed Sauiour, doth perſwade, to the keeping of the Morall Lavv, in euery iote &amp; title of it, vnto the worlds end: Further, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſheweth wherein, or in what manner, he would haue eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21140:75"/>iot &amp; title of the Law kept; and this is two wayes, the one by doctrine, noted in theſe words, <hi>and teach men ſo:</hi> The other by practiſe, noted in theſe words, <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall obſerue &amp;c.</hi> whereby wee ſee, it was the minde of Chriſt, to haue euery title of the lavv, not onely obſerued &amp; practiſed; but alſo, he would haue euery title of it, <hi>taught</hi> vnto the people, &amp; vrged &amp; preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon them: and on the other ſide, becauſe the bare doctrine of the Miniſter, is forceleſſe it. many men, vvithout his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; leaſt they ſhould ſay, he layeth heauy burthens, vpon other men, but himſelfe vvill not touch them, vvith one of his fingers, therefore Chriſt ioyneth practiſe to doctrine, ſaying, <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall obſerue &amp; teach &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, vve are in ſpeciall manner to note, vnto what manner of perſones theſe words are directed, not vnto lay men as they call them, but vnto the Clergie, vnto Miniſters in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall; as vve may vnderſtand by the vvords <hi>teach men ſo:</hi> ſo then, this portion of Scripture, it is directed vnto the Miniſtry; &amp; the vvill of Chriſt to them is, that they ſhall both teach to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and alſo practiſe before them, vnto the worlds end, euery iot and title of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Now in the next place, we haue Chriſt his arguments, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue &amp; perſwade Miniſters, to theſe tvvo dueties; and becauſe Miniſters are of tvvo ſortes; ſome, though but a ſmale ſome, vvill teach and practiſe, euery iot &amp; title of the Lavv, to the vtmoſt of theire povver; but others, vvill neither teach nor practiſe the ſame; therefore hath Chriſt fitted his Arguments, to both ſorts; &amp; by name, to ſuch Miniſters as doe both teach &amp; practiſe; to them our Sauiour promiſeth this bleſſing, that, <hi>they ſhall be called greate in the Kingdome of heauen:</hi> oh that there vvere yet many more, that would couet this greateneſſe in Gods fauour, by teaching &amp; reuealing the whole counſaile of God, euen all his Ten commandements, intirly, in euery iot title of them? But now as for thoſe other Miniſters, vvho refuſe either to teach, or to practiſe, this Lavv of God intirly: to theſe, our Sauiour threateneth a Curſſe, to vvite, that theſe <hi>ſhall be called leaſt in the Kingdome of heauen:</hi> novv vvheras our Sauiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth this curſſe, vnto them, vvhich breake <hi>one of the leaſt of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21140:76"/>theſe commandements:</hi> ſuppoſe vve the Time commanded in the 4th com. vvhere the very leaſt of the commandements becauſe they vſe to cale it, but a circumſtance, and the like; vvhy yet for all that, ſo long as it is a commandement, though the leaſt of all the commandements, yet Chriſt denounceth this Curſſe vnto ſuch Miniſters, as refuſe to teach the people this leaſt com. and refuſe to practiſe it before the people: they haue pleaſed to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcale it a ceremony, &amp; Iudaiſme &amp; the like; but let them try if this vvill free them before Chriſt his Iudgment ſeate, from this Curſſe of Chriſt, vvhich he denounced being on earth. I beleeue all theyre ſubtilties &amp; ſhiftes, vvherby they blind the eyes of men here, vvill hardly ſo blind the eyes of Chriſt then: hee vvill haue an account of his vvholl Lavv, not of peeces and percels of it, as vve pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus vve ſe vvhat the duety of Miniſters is, namely to teach the people, to obſerue the Lords ſeauenth day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which is one of the commandements, though you make it the leaſt: and it is their duetie alſo, if they vvill be freed of Chriſt his Curſſe, to obſerue &amp; keepe the 7th day Sabbath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people; ſo leading them by liefe &amp; doctrine together: but hovv ſarre off, is the practiſe of moſt Teachers from obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the minde &amp; vvill of Chriſt? in ſteade of practiſing the 7th day Sabbath in their ovvne perſones, for example vnto others; they could be content to perſecute any, that they ſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this way; oh fearfull! In ſtead of teaching the people this, vvhich they count the leaſt of Gods commandements, &amp; vrging them to keepe, euery iote and title of Gods Lavv, &amp; ſo the Lords Sabbath day; they teach openly &amp; publikly the quite contrary; as namely, that this leaſt of Gods commandements, it is aboliſhed, and that the Sabbath day, commanded, it is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; thus this leaſt of Gods commandements is trampled downe, becauſe it is a <hi>little</hi> one, &amp; a <hi>ceremoniall</hi> one, &amp; a <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall</hi> one; &amp; not the <hi>Law of Nations,</hi> nor found novv in the hartes off all men falne &amp; corrupted, as a <hi>Law of Nature;</hi> and becauſe commanded <hi>to the Iew,</hi> and the like: but vvhat ſoeuer be their ſhiftes, ſuer Iam the Sabbath day, is not leſſe then one of the iotes and titles of Gods Law; nor is it leſſe then the leaſt of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21140:76"/>Gods commandements; wherefore, vvho ſoeuer teacheth in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to this Sabbath day, he bevvraieth himſelfe to be no frend of Chriſts, and that he regardeth not his mind and vvill, in teaching and obſeruing all &amp; euery of the Commandemets: nay he proclaimeth him ſelfe in open pulpit, to be a profeſſed enemy to Chriſt our Sauiour and theſe his vvordes, Mat. 5.18.19. and to the integrity &amp; vvholneſſe as I may call it of Gods Lavv; he had rather haue it lamed &amp; percelled out, that ſo he might ſerue God by halues, and by peece meale, then to haue an indifferent reſpect vvith <hi>Dauid, vnto all Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Pſal. 119.6. &amp; rather then he vvould haue Gods Lavv intire &amp; compleate, in the perfection of partes, vnto a iote and title.</p>
                     <p>Is not it true of ſuch Miniſters werewith the Lord charged thoſe corrupt <hi>Prieſts,</hi> Mal. 2.9. to vvit, that they were <hi>partiall in the Law?</hi> &amp; are not theſe alſo in our time partiall in Gods Law, when not with ſtanding vvhat Chriſt hath ſaid, for the integrity of the Lavv, yet theſe men wil reiect a parte of it, and ſo become like thoſe Prieſts, partiall in Gods Lavv? for a parte of Gods Lavv they vvill haue; an other parte they vvill none of: the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of reſt and holineſſe in the 4th com. this parte of the 4th com. they vvill haue, but the other duetie of the Time, this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of the ſame 4th com: they vvill none of. Were theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the lovver ranke for zeale, &amp; of the Number of thoſe vvhich are not accounted ſo zelouſe of Gods Lavves, it vvere the leſſe to be vvondred at; but being puritant Miniſters, and ſuch as vvould be diſpleaſed at him, vvho ſhould ſay to them, they had not an indifferent reſpect vnto all Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vvith out exceptions; that theſe I ſay ſhould picke and chooſe, take &amp; leaue; &amp; become like thoſe profane Prieſts, <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall in Gods Law,</hi> it is to be maruailed at; Miſtake me not good Reader, it is not purity that I miſlike in puritanes; for of all men I honour no men more, then ſuch as are, &amp; endeauour to be, of pure harte &amp; holy liefe: but this I hate in them; to ſe their practiſe belye their doctrine &amp; profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for they teach daily for vniverſall obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to all Gods com. without exceptions &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſernations; but Loe they are found here halting: one of the leaſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21140:77"/>(as they ſay) of Gods Commandements, ratified by our Sauiour, they neglect and contemne.</p>
                     <p>Others there be of the ſame ranke, which be not ſo impudent as the former, they preach &amp; teach not againſt the Lords Sabbaths, &amp; therefore are not guilty of the Curſſe of Chriſt, for breaking this leaſt Com. &amp; <hi>teaching men ſo:</hi> yet are they enemies to this leaſt Comm. for haueing heard of my former booke, which I vvrote in defence of this leaſt Com. and for the Lords Sabbath; yea, and after they haue ſeene it, &amp; reade it ouer, they ſpitt fyer at it; &amp; cry out, burne the booke; tis a foule errour, &amp;c. Theſe men like <hi>Iames &amp; Iohn,</hi> not knovving of vvhat Spirit they are, vvould haue fyer come downe preſently; &amp; although they know not, either how to proue their Lords day to be a Sabbath day; nor yet hovv to diſproue the Lords Sabbath day; or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the booke, yet they can cry, burne the booke, tis a foule errour, &amp;c. Thus theſe are ſo farre from teaching this leaſt com. to the people; as that they vſe all their diligence, to ſcare &amp; afright ſimple people, vvith greate vvords; that ſo they might ſtill remaine caught in theire ſnares, &amp; in blind ignorance: if the Lawes of this Realme, vvere fitted to theſe mens minds, it ſhould be vvoe to him that toucheth this Lords day Sabbath, the <hi>Diana</hi> of our time; but ſeing they doe it out of a good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I ſhall vvith Paul make it <hi>mine hearts deſire, and prayer to God</hi> for them, that they may repent; <hi>for I beare them witneſſe, that they haue the Zeale of God, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They thinke it much, that they cannot preuaile vvith the rude multitude, for the keeping Holy of the Lords day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but that, ſay they vvhat they can, yet they will reuell, riote &amp; profane it: vvell the caſe is novv become their ovvne; it ſhall be ſeene, whither all that I haue ſaid, can preuaile vvith them, for the ſanctifying of the Lords Sabbaths on the 7th day: ſuer I am I haue ſaid, &amp; ſhall ſay much more, &amp; more ſoundly, for the 7th day Sabbath, to moue them to keepe it; then euer they did, or could ſay, to profane perſones, for the keeping of the 8th day Sabbath: if therfore, ſyniſter affections, preuaile ſo vvith them, that they vvill not liften to mee, no more then
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21140:77"/>their profane hearers will to them; let them tell me then, what is the difference betvvixt them ſelues, and their profane audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</p>
                     <p>An other ſorte there are, who are diſobedient to Chriſts will, by deniall of the integrity, wholneſſe, &amp; perfection of Gods law; in as much as they doe not onely refuſe to teach the people, this leaſt of Gods commandements, namely, which is the proper day &amp; time of Gods worſhip &amp; ſeruice; but if they finde, that by the paines of any others, more faithfull in this point then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, any of their flocke are taught &amp; inſtructed in this way of the Lord more perfectly, that they begin to ſee a further light into this Law of God, then they were wont; preſently they be labour it, to extinguiſh this light in them: to theſe, I may fitly apply that word of the Lord, Ierem. 23.30. <hi>Therefore behold, I will come againſt the Prophets, ſaith the Lord, that ſteale my word, euery one from his neighbour.</hi> Theſe then, be ſacrilegiouſe theeues, who will not ſow the ſeed of Gods word, in the hearts of their people, but vvill watch vvhen it is ſowne, that they may come &amp; ſteale it away againe.</p>
                     <p>I truſt Gods Miniſters, will bridle corrupt nature, and giue me leaue to lay the plaiſter, where the ſore is; knowing it is their office, to doe the like to others dayly; they vvho teach others to take a reproofe, are not to learne in this point.</p>
                     <p>Let me ſpeake one vvord novv, to all theſe 3 ſortes of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters together: vvhy are yee, you Tribe of <hi>Leuie,</hi> ſuch enemies to the integrity, wholneſſe, &amp; perfection of the Lavv of your God? deliuered vvith ſuch maieſtie and terrour, vpon Mount Sinai Exod. 20? Why oppoſe you your ſelues alſo, againſt thoſe <hi>iotes</hi> &amp; <hi>titles</hi> of this lavv, ratified by our Lord Chriſt, vnto eternity, in his ſermon on the Mount Mat. 5.1.8? Why doe you not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his vvill &amp; mind, teach the people, this leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, touching the proper time of his worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice? Nay, why are you ſo vnlike your ſelues? For it is a rule approued in expounding of the Scriptures, that <hi>things are to be taken in the largeſt ſenſe, if nothing hinder.</hi> Now why then in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of this 4th com. doe you abridge it, excluding the proper time thereof, as if nothing but the dueties of reſt and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21140:78"/>holineſſe, belonged vnto vs? Whereas you ought to expound it more largly, as including both the time of the 7th day, &amp; the dueties of reſt &amp; holineſſe alſo? ſince there is nothing that you can iuſtly ſay againſt the time. Againe, it is another rule in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouding of Scripture, &amp; in ſpeciall of the Morall law; that <hi>vnder one thing expreſly commanded or forbidden, are comprehended all of that kind, with the leaſt cauſe or occaſion thereof:</hi> See here how they enlarge the lavv, to be vnderſtood, not onely of the things there by name mentioned, but alſo, of things not mentioned, as of the <hi>cauſes &amp; occaſions:</hi> and yet the ſame men, being to expound the 4th com. are ſo farre off, from enlarging it, as they will miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie curtaile it, and clippe it, and pare it, vntill they haue quite pared away, the 7th day Sabbath: Why are you ſo inconſtant, &amp; ſo vnlike your ſelues? is it a rule with you, that things not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Comm. are to be brought in, that ſo the Com. may haue the largeſt ſcope &amp; compaſſe; and will you exclude and thruſt out, things by name, mentioned in the Com. as the 7th day Sabbath?</p>
                     <p>Againe, when we are to deale againſt Papiſts, then we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zealouſe for the integrity &amp; perfection of the law: witneſſe <hi>M. Perkins</hi> in his firſt Volume pag. 400. where he proueth that <hi>a Papiſt</hi> cannot goe beyond <hi>a Reprobate;</hi> becauſe they make the whole law vaine: and this he affirmeth in theſe words, <hi>If one frustrate but any one point, of any one commandement, the whole law thereby is made in vaine.</hi> Cannot a Papiſt goe beyond a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, if he fruſtrate <hi>any one point, of any one commandement?</hi> &amp; can <hi>a Proteſtant</hi> goe beyond <hi>a Reprobate,</hi> when he doeth fruſtrate ſome one point, in ſome one commandement? as we doe in the 4th comm.? Muſt the law ſtand, in euery point, of euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, vvhen we haue to doe vvith our Aduerſaries abroade, &amp; is the caſe altered, when we be among our ſelues at home?</p>
                     <p>It is made a marke of ſincerity, and of the trueth of grace, vvhen a man hath reſpect, vnto all Gods commandements, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception of any: But come vpon the matter with them, &amp; then they that deliuer this marke to others, can ſcarcely finde it in themſelues: For, albeit they ſeeme by this marke, to iuſtify the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21140:78"/>law, in the integrity and perfection of it; yet aske them what they thinke of Gods 7th day Sabbath, commanded in the 4th com. and this they will baulke and except, vnder one pretenſe or other, by miſcalling it Iewiſh, Ceremoniall, and by ſaying falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it is aboliſhed: and is this the reſpect they haue vnto all Gods commandements?</p>
                     <p>It is a rule alſo, that <hi>the law it is wholly copulatiue;</hi> that is, the things therein commanded, are firmly combined &amp; knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo as not any one thing can be ſeuered from the law: and thus farre they maintaine the law, in its perfection &amp; integrity; but how then cometh it about, that novv you haue made ſuch a <hi>hiatus,</hi> ſuch a gape in this lavv? one of the Linkes of this chaine is broken, the commanded time of 7th day, in the 4th com. is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, and ſeuered from all the reſt: ſo novv this <hi>copulation</hi> is <hi>vncoupled,</hi> and the lavv is not wholly copulatiue, it is but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially copulatiue.</p>
                     <p>Behold how the ene<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mies to the Lords Sabbaths, &amp; to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity &amp; perfection of the Lavv of God ſay, and vnſay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: abroad vvith our aduerſaries, tis a point of <hi>reprobation,</hi> to fruſtrate but <hi>any one point, of any one commandement:</hi> at home, tis a point of <hi>Iudaiſme,</hi> to maintaine &amp; defend them all. What ſhould I ſay more? iuſtly may the Lord lament ouer <hi>England,</hi> as once he did ouer <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſaying, <hi>O my people, they that leade thee, cauſe thee to erre,</hi> Iſa. 3.12.</p>

                     <p>As there is no Chriſtian Church in the world, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21140:79"/>this Law of God intirly, &amp; in its perfection: So is there no member of our Church, that I know, who inioyeth this Lavv, in its integrity, in his iudgment, &amp; practiſe both; albeit it were much to bewiſhed, it being the Inheritance of the Church, wherin euery member may challeng his ſhare. I diuide our Church &amp; Congregations therfore, in to two ſortes, purpoſing to make application of this doctrine, vnto them both: the one ſorte, &amp; that the feweſt by infinite numbers, are ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, in their iudgments, &amp; inlightened in this Law of God, in the integrity &amp; perfection of the partes therof: The other ſorte, &amp; thoſe the moſt, remaine yet it darkneſſe, &amp; ignorance of this their Inheritance, the Law of God in its perfection. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the former ſorte, is it ſo, that thou loueſt: his Law of God? then let this thy loue to it appeare: &amp; that by harty &amp; firuent prayers vnto Almightie God daily, that he vvould be pleaſed to infuſe, the light of this knowledge, in to the minds &amp; haerts of all men: &amp; that it would pleaſe God, to incline the heart of our ſoueraigne Lord &amp; <hi>King,</hi> together with all the greate gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in Church &amp; Common weale, to embrace this Law of God, in its integrity &amp; perfection; that ſo a reformaiion being made, we may inioy the Lords Sabbath, in practiſe, as well as in iudgment.</p>
                     <p>To this end, two things are required of thee, who arte already inlightened, &amp; doeſt loue this Lavv of God in the perfection thereof: the one is, that thou further &amp; diſperſe the knowledge thereof, as farre forth as thy place &amp; calling will peremit, vnto thy frends &amp; acquaintance; thus did Dauid, <hi>Teach me thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, (ſaith he)</hi> &amp; then he addeth theſe words, <hi>with my lipps haue I declared, all the iudgments of thy mouth,</hi> Pſ. 119.12.13. and againe, <hi>I will ſpeake of thy Teſtimones before Kings, &amp; will not be a ſhamed,</hi> Pſ. 119.46. Hereto accordeth S. Paul, <hi>wherefore exhorte one an other, &amp; edify one an other, euen as you doe,</hi> 1. Theſ. 5.12. and, <hi>Exhorte one an other daily, while it is called to day,</hi> Heb. 3.13. he that loueth the Law, muſt not onely loue it in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, but alſo in the practiſe of it, &amp; hovv ſhall he attaine the practiſe of it, vnleſe it be made knowne vnto all, that ſo a generall reformation may be.</p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:21140:80"/>
                     <p> The other thing required of thee, is that in loue to Gods Law, thou beeſt redy in thy place, to defend it, &amp; the integrity &amp; perfection of it, againſt all gainſayers: as the Apoſtle <hi>Iude</hi> ſaith, <hi>contend for the maintenance of the faith, which was once giuen vnto the Saints,</hi> Iud. 3. ſo ſhould we contend, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the integrity and perfection of the Law, which vvas once giuen vnto the Saints and Church of God. This is that, vvhich God laied to the charge of his Church long ſince, that, <hi>No man contendeth for the trueth,</hi> Iſai. 59.4. bevvare it be not laid to our charge alſo. Moſes had many brethren, the Hebrewes, yet vvould he not ſuffer any one of them, to ſuffer vvrong of the Egyptianes, but roſe vp in their defence, and defended them ſo, one after an other, that at laſt he vvas forced to flie for his ovvne liefe, Exod. 2.11.15. ſo vve brethren, if vve loue this Lavv of God, it vvill Kindle in vs, an holy zeale of Gods glory, &amp; indignation againſt the enemies of Gods trueth, ſo as vve ſhall riſe vp to defend &amp; reſcve any one, and euery one of Gods commandements, againſt thoſe that would be ſhredding &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reing ſome thing or other avvay from the ſame. Dauid ſaith <hi>Gods teſtimonies they were the ioy of his harte:</hi> and againe, <hi>oh how lou: I thy Law?</hi> thinke vve that Dauid, could vvith patience haue ſeene this Lavv, vvhich he ſo loued, mangled and hacked, and ſo defaced, as vve novv are forced to behould it?</p>
                     <p>I come novv to the other ſorte of people in our Church, &amp; they are thoſe vvho be yet in darkneſſe, &amp; ignorance; vvho al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they know much of this Lavv of God, yea the moſt of it, yet are ignerant of it in its integrity &amp; perfection; for they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Gods 7th day Sabbath conteined in his 4th com. and ſo they knovv not all the Lavv, they are not acquainted vvith the vvhole Lavv, and vvill of God; for number, theſe are the moſt, and therfore the caſe is the more lamentable: yea and by ſo much alſo the more lamentable yet, in that they are not fully inſtructed in a matter, vvhich neerly concerneth them; for this they muſt take ſpeciall notice of, to vvit, that by this Lavv vve ſhall be iudged at that dreadfull day of iudgment, <hi>as many as haue ſinned in the Law, ſhall hr iudged by Law,</hi> Rom. 2.12. and againe, <hi>ſo ſpeake yee, and ſo doe yee, as they that ſhall beiudged by

Now it is a fearefull thing, for a man to be ignorant of any one parte ar percell of that Lavv, vvhereby he ſhall be adiudged: it concernes euery man ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to ſtudy this Lavv, and to take in information of it, &amp; of all the partes of it, &amp; that vvith ſpeed.</p>
                     <p>But you may ſay, hovv ſhall this exhortation, to loue the Lavv of God, in its perfection, concerne ſuch as you ſay are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Lavv, as touching its perfection? can a man loue the thing vnknovvne? for anſwer hereunto, we muſt know, that how euer a man may he be ſaid to be ignorant of a thing, as by it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, &amp; in particular: yet may he be ſaid to knovv it, and ſo alſo to loue it, by an other, &amp; in the generall: I make it plaine thus; he that loues one or more peeces of gold, as gold, he loues all pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of gold; and as vvell thoſe peeces in generall, vvhich he neuer ſawe, as thoſe peeces in particular, which he hath ſeene: &amp; by thoſe particular peeces, vvhich he hath ſeene, &amp; found good &amp; pleſant vnto him, he comes to know that the other peeces vnſeene, being of like nature, they are alſo good &amp; pleſant, and ſo he growes in loue vvith them alſo: The caſe is a like, in him that hath the Inheritance of A Lord ſhip or Manner deſcended vnto him, be it that he neuer ſaw nor knevv, ſome particular Cloſſe, Field, or Tenement of his Inheritance, yet he hath a loue vnto theſe vnknovvne partes of his inheritance, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: &amp; by the experimentall commodety he finds, by ſome of the knovvne partes of his inheritance, he grovves in to loue of the vnknovve partes alſo: So it is in this our caſe; tis true the moſt of men, they knovv not the Lavv of God, their inheritance, in all the partes of it, particularly, and by themſelues; yet for all that, they haue a knovvledge &amp; ſo a loue to Gods Lavv, and to the vnknovvne partes of it, in the generall, and by the other knovvne partes; in ſo much as, many that are ignorant of ſome one or more points, in the particular, and by them ſelues, can yet truely ſay, that they loue the Lavv of God, and the Lavv too, in its integrity &amp; perfection; and out of this loue in the generall and by other partes, they vnfeinedly deſire to be made acquainted vvith thoſe vnknovvne partes in the particular, that they might, loue them for themſelues alſo.</p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:21140:81"/>
                     <p> To apply this, doeſt thou then loue the Lavv of God, why make it appeare then, both to thine ovvne heart, and vnto all men, by thy loue vnto the vnknovvne partes of it; for he that loueth ſome peeces of gold in trueth, he loueth all peeces of gold alſo, as well thoſe vnſeene as thoſe he hath ſeene; ſo muſt thou doe, if thy loue to Gods Law be ſound, thou muſt be in loue vvith all the parts of Gods law, in its integrity; as well with thoſe vnknowne, as with thoſe alredy knowne.</p>
                     <p>The way vvherby thou muſt make knowne thy loue, vnto the vnknovvne partes of Gods Lavv, is in theſe two things: In an earneſt deſire to become acquainted in particular, vvith thoſe vnknovvne partes of Gods Lavv; and, in a redy vvilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to embrace the knovvledge of them, vvhen occation by Gods mercy is offred thee.</p>
                     <p>For the former, as Dauid, deſiring to be deliuered from his ſinnes, praid not only againſt his knowne ſinnes, but al ſo againſt his onknowne ſinnes, ſaying, <hi>cleanſe me from ſecret faultes,</hi> Pſ. 19.12. ſo we muſt deſire &amp; that erneſtely, not onely the conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the knovvledge of the knovvne partes of Gods Lavv, but alſo the knovvledge of the vnknovvne and ſecret partes of Gods Lavv: vve haue the Prophet Dauid a notable patterne in this point, hovv erneſt a ſuiter, vnto God vvas he in this caſe? <hi>Open mine eyes (ſaith he) that I may ſee the wonders of thy Law:</hi> &amp; againe <hi>Hide not thy commandements from me</hi> &amp; againe, <hi>giue me vnderſtanding, that I may learne thy Commandements.</hi> And then, his heart burſteth againe vvith eagre deſire thereof, <hi>mine heart breaketh (ſaith he) for the deſire to thy iudgments.</hi> Thus if there be in vs a firuent loue vnto Gods Lavv, as there vvas in Dauid, vve vvill neuer be at reſt, vntill vve knovv Gods Lavv yet bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more fully, euen vnto perfection. The ſecond thing, to vvit, a ready vvillingneſſe to imbrace this knovvledge, vvhen it is tendred thee: this needeth no proof, for it follovveth of it ovvne accord; think you that after the Prophet Dauid, had thus beſought God by prayers, for further knovvledge of Gods Lavv, that then he vvould not haue vvith both his armes, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him, that vvould haue inſtructed him? <hi>how beautifull are the feete, of them which bring glad tydiuges!</hi> Gods Lavv he
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21140:81"/>called it, <hi>the ioy of his heart: his inheritance; it was better vnto him then thouſands of gold &amp; ſiluer.</hi> Would not a man be redy to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ioy of his heart? an inheritance? and that which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then gold and ſiluer, when tis tendred him? Yis vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; why ſuch is the law of God, &amp; ſuch alſo will be thy redineſſe to entertaine it when tendered, if truely thou loueſt Gods law, as Dauid did.</p>
                     <p>I come now to apply the former of the tvvo points: Is it ſo, that whoſoeuer loueth Gods law in trueth, and ſincerly, cannot but expreſſe his <hi>deſirs</hi> to the vnknowne partes of it? Then hereby may men iudge of their eſtate to Godward, to know whither they doe indeed &amp; in trueth, ſincerly &amp; vnfeinedly, loue Gods lavv, or not: doeſt thou deſire the knovvledge of all Gods lavv, as well as of ſome of it? Doeſt thou deſire the knovvledge of the vnknovvne partes, as well as thou loueſt the knovvledge of the knovvne partes? then is thine eſtate good to Godvvard, and doubtleſſe, thou loueſt the lavv of God in trueth of heart, and in ſincerity: but if thou contenteſt thy ſelfe, vvith the knovvledge of that thou doeſt knovv, not deſiring to knovv more, if more may be knovvne; thy caſe is dangerouſe; it is to be ſuſpected, that thy loue to Gods law, is but a fained loue, &amp; hypocriticall, &amp; that thou art rotten at the Core, &amp; not ſounde at the heart: For, he that loueth one peece of gold, he loueth all other peeces of gold; he that loueth one parte of his inheritance, he loueth euery part and parcell thereof, knovvne and vnknovvne vnto him.</p>
                     <p>Let the moſt men, both Miniſters &amp; people, be examined by this rule, &amp; their loue to Gods lavves, vvill be ſuſpected: tis true indeed, they pray dayly, both in publike &amp; in priuate, that God vvould increaſe their knovvledge, &amp; open their blind eyes; as Dauid did, <hi>Open mine eyes that J may ſee the wonders of thy Law;</hi> but doe they pray vvith Dauids heart, ſincerly? Doe they not pray with ſecret and reſerued exceptions, and reſeruations? doe they not indent with God ſecretly in heart, how farre they will be inlightened, &amp; how farre not; how farre they vvill know of Gods will, &amp; how farre they will be ignorant ſtill? Let vs try both Miniſters, &amp; people. For Miniſters, haue they not ſuch a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21140:82"/>diſtinction as this, nouriſhed in their mindes? to wit, that there be ſome things vnknowne of Gods will, the knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would make much to their praiſe and applauſe, &amp; would be well approued of by all their brethren, and would be a meanſe to eſtabliſh them in their liuings, if not to enlarge them; and would not croſſe, but rather be vpholden by Antiquity, &amp; vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſality &amp;c? &amp; there be other things vnknowne of Gods will, the knowledge whereof would but tend to their reproch and ſhame, and would be generally diſtaſted of all the Miniſtry, and might be a meanſe to depriue them of their liuings, they croſſing all Antiquity &amp; vniuerſality &amp;c? in ſo much as if God ſhould now demand, of theſe petitioners, what they would haue of him, whither that he ſhould beſtow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them the whole knowledge of his will intirly, whither it make with them or againſt them; or onely that part thereof, which might tend to their preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modety, it is to be vehemently ſuſpected, they would chooſe this latter onely, albeit they would bluſh to ſay ſo: I appeale to their conſciences examined, if I hit not the marke: the reaſon of my ſuch ſuſpicion is this, in part, The knowledge of this part of Gods law, touching his Sabbaths, it is not put vpon them to ſtudy it out, with great paines, but it is brought home to their dores, redy ſtudied for them. 2. The point is moſt eaſy &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to be vnderſtood, no difficulties in it, ſaue what themſelues doe voluntarily &amp; vnneceſſarily put vpon it, by their vaine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, &amp; friuolouſe obiections (as ſome thing may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected againſt any thing): that it is eaſy, I know it my ſelfe, for I haue fathomed it, &amp; diued good deepe into the bottome of it. I know it alſo by others, both of the Miniſtry and priuate men, who can ſee it cleerly and without difficulty. Wherefore I can impute their ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to nothing elſe, but that they are willing to be ignorant, &amp; haue no deſires to be acquainted, with that vnprofitable &amp; incommodiouſe part of Gods will: for vvhat is there in this controuercy of the Sabbath, that exceedeth the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacety euen of the meaneſt? but eſpecially if you ſpeake of Miniſters, who haue a dexterity (when they will) in vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtions of Diuinity, it is not poſſible for them to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, had they a willing mind. I am very confident, that if
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:21140:82"/>they prayed to God, out of an vnfeined ſincere loue to Gods Law, that he would informe them, in the vnproffitable part of his will, as vvell as in the proffitable part, that God would ſoone ſend them a cleere light thereof, eſpecially, ſince the way is now made ſo open &amp; eaſy. I wiſh they vvould but make experience of God in this caſe, according to my counſaile &amp; deſire, and if they doe not, it will be bitterneſſe firſt or laſt: In a word, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue heard that Gods Sabbath is now in queſtion: but which of them haue gone into their ſtudies, and deeply minded the point, out of a deſire to find it &amp; defend it, if it might be found and defended? I appeale to their conſciences.</p>
                     <p>Let vs novv try the people by this rule, and ſee if there be not, like Prieſt, like people: it is true, theſe pray for an increaſe of knovvledge in Gods lawes alſo: but doe they meane to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a knowledge of all the law of God wholly? or of ſo much onely as may ſerue the time, and pleaſe their Miniſters? what their <hi>deſire</hi> is ſhall appeare by their practiſe; tis voiced abroade, that the Lords Sabbaths are profaned, the 4th comman. weekly tranſgreſſed; and that there is a booke newly come forth to that effect: well, how doe people now behaue themſelues vpon theſe tidings? If a man ſhould cry fyer, fyer, in the night, ſo in loue men are vvith their houſen, and ſo deſirouſe to preſerue them, that inſtantly they ſtartle, leape out their bedds, make inquiry where? and ſearch round about their houſen, without and with in, and will not be perſwaded to bedd againe till they be ſuer all is ſafe: Did men loue Gods lawes, as they doe their houſen and poſſeſſions, they vvould not be at reſt till they had ſcanned the point, and examined the booke ouer againe and againe.</p>
                     <p>But I ſhall tell you one of the ordinary queſtions, they moue vpon theſe tidings, to wit, what think you <hi>Sir,</hi> may not a man goe to heauen in the ould opinion though he be ignorant of this parte of Gods word, touching his proper Sabbath? to paſſe by what I thinke of heauen, let me tell you vvhat I know of hell: I am ſuer a man may goe to hell in the ould opinion: theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions way intimate, that men reſolue to giue to God, no more ſeruice then what neglected, they plung body &amp; ſoule in to hell fier; this is no filiall but a ſeruile minde &amp; affection: this is farre
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:21140:83"/>from Dauids prayer, <hi>open thou mine eyes that I may ſee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of thy Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let me tell you alſo, the ſucceſſe which theſe tidinges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce vvith moſt others: ſay they it were much to be wiſhed, this booke had neuer comne forth, that this point bad neuer bene queſtioned; I wiſh the Authour had bene better aduiſed; it vvill cauſe much ſtirre in the Church, before we vvere finly quiet, &amp; this novv vvill caſt rubbes in our vvay, our conſciences vvill be checking of vs, &amp;c. All the anſvver theſe ſhall haue from me, is to aduiſe them to ſee to it, that by ſuch obiections, they be not like to thoſe rebelliouſe Ievves, vvho vvould not receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, vvhen God vvould haue taught them, <hi>children that would not heare the Law of the Lord: which ſay vnto the Seers, ſee not: and to the Prophets, propheſie not vnto vs right things: but ſpeake ſtattering things vnto vs, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 30.9.10. to conclude, let theſe their common obiections ſpeake for them, if therby they doe not bevvray, that in their prayers, they intend to obtaine no more of God, but a partiall knovvledge of his Lavv; and this their partiality, may breed a ſhrewd ſuſpition, their loue to Gods Law, is not ſound and ſincere: for if it vvere, they vvould not reiect the meanes of knovvledge, before they haue taſted it. So much be ſpoken by vvay of vſe, from this, that an vnfeined loue of Gods Lavv, cannot but deſire the knovvledge of the vnknovvne partes thereof.</p>
                     <p>I come novv to make ſome application of that other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: is it ſo, that vvho ſo loueth Gods Lavv in trueth, he vvill vvith all redineſſe, cherefulneſſe, and vvillingneſſe <hi>imbrace</hi> the knovvledge of the vnknovvn partes thereof, vvhen the ſame is tendred vnto him: if vve ſhall put men vpon the triall for this point alſo, here vve ſhall in the firſt place find many in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery guilty: hovv vnvvilling they are, that the knovvledge of this parte of Gods Lavv, touching his Sabbaths, ſhould come abroade into the vvorld, or into their owne heads; both their ovvne conſciences are priuy to, and the vvorld takes knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of: vvere the knovvledge of a good liuing tendred them, I dare ſay it, fevve or none of them, but vvould haue runne and ridd about it, vvith all diligence, long before this: could any
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:21140:83"/>man informe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though but doubtfully, of ſome Tyeth vnpaid, belonging to their liuings; if Lavvyers vvould not bring them Counſaile, they vvould ride &amp; make out to them for counſaile aboute the matter: and all their vvites, &amp; frends ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for to find it out, as they vvould haue it, if it vvere poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: but novv the Tyeth of Gods Lavv, or a portion of the tieth at leaſt, is detayned from God, and from themſelues, by themſelues; and here they vvill neither runne, nor ride, nor aſke for Counſaile, in this caſe; no nor accept &amp; vvelcome it, vvhen it is brought, &amp; thruſt in to their heades: it giues a man to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that theſe loue more vnfeinedly a good liuing, then Gods law: Nay I cannot but thinke, that if I had tendered vnto ſome Miniſters a liuing of 50<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. a yeere, &amp; that vpon no better euidence &amp; title, then in my former booke I tendred them the Lords Sabbaths; I cannot thinke I ſay, that any man in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome could wreſt it out of their hands: In a word, theſe that are ſo mindeleſſe of Gods lavv, vvhen they are ſo mindfull of their owne liuings, like as God ſaid, vnto his people the Iewes, when they neglected the building of the Temple, &amp; yet were dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to builde themſelues houſes, <hi>Is it time for you to dwell in your ſeiled houſes, and this houſe lie waſte?</hi> Hagg. 1.4. So may I ſay vnto them, Is it time for you yee Miniſters, to enioy your liuings, when the Lords Sabbaths lie waſte? God muſt haue a rekoning of you for theſe things.</p>
                     <p>This rule being applied to common people, will detect them alſo: Is it ſo, that whoſoeuer loueth Gods law in trueth, he will with all redineſſe &amp; willingneſſe, <hi>imbrace</hi> the knowledge of the vnknowne partes thereof? Then, if I ſhall make it appeare, that moſt men are vnwilling, to imbrace the knowledge of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvne partes of Gods lavv, it vvill follovv very ſuſpiciouſly, that moſt men doe not loue the law of God in trueth, what euer they ſay, &amp; thinke to the contrary: Thus I make it good againſt them: The doctrine of Gods Sabbaths, is a parte of the lavv, &amp; it is the vnknovvne part of Gods lavv: Novv the knowledge of this, being tendered vnto men, they bevvray their vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be taught &amp; inſtructed in it, &amp; that two wayes; the one is, in that vvhen the matter cometh to tryall, they admit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21140:84"/>
                        <hi>Artificiall</hi> arguments; for, they preferr feeble and weake reaſons, before ſtrong and able reaſones: the other is, in that they admit of inſufficient <hi>Inartificiall</hi> argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; for they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and allow of diſſallowable and vnſufficient Teſtimonyes to decide this controuercy by: vvhen theſe two things are made plaine, the caſe vvill goe cleere againſt them: for a foundation, firſt of all, ſuppoſe we, the point in controuercy, to wit, this vnknowne parte of Gods Law, touching his Sabbathes, is as diſputable, contingent, queſtionable, &amp; as doubtfull as you will; in ſo much as in your very conſciences you thinke, it may be, &amp; it may not be a trueth; and that it is as likly not to be true, as to be true; let all this be granted; perhaps there is ſome reaſon it ſhold be granted, ſeeing that it is a point not heard of before by common people, neither haue they euer ſpent any time in the ſtudy of the point. Well be it ſo, I proceed then.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, to vvit, that vvhen the point of Gods Sabbaths comes to be argued, people, yea Miniſters alſo, admit of inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient arguments, preferring them before able &amp; ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and this ſhall appeare, by comparing together, the reaſons brought onboth ſides: the reaſons brought for the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, among others are theſe, 1. Gods expreſſe Com. Exod. 20.8. <hi>Remember the Sabbath day:</hi> and, <hi>In it thou ſhalt not doe any worke:</hi> 2. Chriſt ratified it, vvhen he vvith ſo vehement an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeueration, auovvched the duration of euery iot and title of the Lavv, vnto the vvorlds end, ſaying, <hi>Verily, I ſay vnto you, vntill heauen &amp; earth periſh one iote or one title of the Law ſhall not eſcape, vntill all things be fulfilled.</hi> And againe, <hi>whoſoeuer therfore, ſhall breake one of theſe leaſt commandements, and teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdome of heauen,</hi> Mat. 5.18.19. On the other ſide, the reaſons brought againſt Gods Sabbathes, by thoſe which are the enemies therof are theſe, Gal. 4.10. <hi>ye obſerue dayes, and moneths, and times, and yeeres, &amp;c.</hi> and Col. 2.16. <hi>let no man condemne you in meate, &amp; drinke, or in reſpect of an holy day, or of the new Moone, or of the Sabbath dayes.</hi> Novv let theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts on both ſides, be laid into the ballances; they, for the Lords Sabbath, in to the one balla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; they, againſt the Lords Sabbath in to the other ballance, and then iudg thou good Reader, vvhither hath the greater weight.</p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:21140:84"/>
                     <p> For breuityſake, we wil compare onely theſe two textes, Exo. 20.8. and Col. 2.16. The one, thou ſeeſt is a Commandement, and a Morall Commandement, &amp; it toucheth the very point in queſtion, to vvit, the 7th day Sabbath: yea that the 4th Com. intendeth the ſeauenth day Saturday Sabbath is ſo plaine, as vvas it neuer doubted of by any. The other, thou ſeeſt is a diſſvvaſion from Sabbath dayes, indefinitly, that is, from ſome Sabbath dayes, for the Apoſtle ſaith not, <hi>all</hi> Sabbath dayes in generall, but Sabbath dayes, as of ſome Sabbath dayes, in ſpeciall: ſo then this texte toucheth not the point in queſtion, to wit, the 7th day Sabbath: but other annuall ceremoniall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, if this Text, did make ought againſt the Morall 7th day Sabbath, it muſt ſpeake of all Sabbathes, generally in the largeſt ſenſe; that ſo the Morall Sabbath might be included &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned too, but the text doth not mention the note of general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <hi>(all)</hi> neither is it neceſſarily to be collected: for 1. their owne expoſiters as <hi>Perkins, Dod, Greenham, Elton, Ames,</hi> with diuerſe others (as ſhall be ſhovvne) doe limite this text, vnto ſome Sabbaths, as vnto the ceremoniall yeerly Sabbaths; and. 2. The text giueth light vnto it, for it condemneth onely ſuch things as neuer vvere vvrote in the Morall Law, as <hi>meate,</hi> and <hi>drinke,</hi> and <hi>new moones, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore vve iudge the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths condemned in this Text, to be onely ſuch Sabbaths alſo, as vvere neuer vvrote in the 10 Commandements, as their yeerly Sabbaths: ſo the vveekly Sabbaths in the 4th Com. ſtand ſtill vntoucht, by this text. 3, ſuppoſe vve, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had ſpake not onely of Sabbaths <hi>plurally,</hi> but alſo of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths <hi>generally,</hi> &amp; had vſed the particle <hi>all,</hi> ſaying, <hi>all Sabbaths;</hi> yet vve knovv, that the particle <hi>all,</hi> is often times reſtrained in Scripture, &amp; is not taken in the largeſt ſenſe that may be, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe theſe Scriptures, 1. Cor. 6.12. 1. Cor. 9.25. 1. Corint. 10.23.33. 1. Cor. 13.2.7. 1. Cor. 15.22. vvhereby vve ſee, that this their text Col. 2.16. may be vnderſtood of ſome Sabbaths onely, as namely of the yeerly Sabbaths, and ſo thers no neceſſity it ſhould touch the morall vveekly Sabbaths at all.</p>
                     <p>Iudge novv good Reader, whither of theſe two textes are more for the purpoſe; for, the 4th com. it is vnderſtood directly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21140:85"/>of the 7th day vveekly Sabbaths: but the text Col. 2.16. is, and may be vnderſtood of the yeerly Sabbaths: and foraſmuch as none euer doubted, that the 4th com. was for the weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths; and many haue vvrote it, that this text Col. 2.16. ſpeaketh not of the vveekly Sabbaths, it is partiality to chooſe Col. 2.16. before Exod. 20.8. Whither is the more ſafe thinke you, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Lords Sabbaths, from the 4th Com. or, to reiect them, from this text Col. 2.16? Ponder it vvell in your minds, vvhither of theſe tvvo textes of Scripture, ſhould moſt preuaile with you, to vvit, Exod. 20.8. or Col. 2.16. &amp; this note alſo, that if this text Col. 2.16. preuaile with you, then it muſt eate out the very heart &amp; bowels of the 4th Com. If you imbrace the text in their ſenſe, to be vnderſtood of the 7th day vveekly Sabbaths: therefore beware what you doe: but if you vnderſtand this text Col. 2.16. onely of the yeerly Sabbaths, ſuch as you reade of Leuit. 23.24.32.39. So you may retaine both textes ſtill, &amp; one Scripture ſhall not ſhoulder out an other. I haue the rather inciſted vpon this texte of theirs Col. 2.16. becauſe it is their Maſter, chiefe, and choiſeſt text againſt the Lords Sabbaths.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly that you may the better iudge of theſe two textes Exod. 20.8. &amp; Col. 2.16. note, that not theſe tvvo textes are compared together, as Scripture, vvith Scripture; but the collection &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of one of theſe textes, is compared with, and ſet againſt the other Text it ſelfe: for, as for the Text Exod. 20.8. this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the 7th day, vveekly Sabbath expreſly, in ſo many words, with out collection, or conſequence, of ours: the 4th com. hath euer bene vnderſtood of the 7th day &amp; weekly Sabbaths, by all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> &amp; by <hi>Chriſt</hi> him ſelfe, witnes their practiſe: but the Text, Col. 2.16. doth not diſſwad from the 7th day weekly Sabbath, expreſly, and in ſo many vvords; but it muſt be dravvne, haled, and vvreſted to the 7th day, weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, by feeble blind reaſon, collectiones, &amp; conſequences: ſo that vvhoſoeuer doth imbrace the Text, Col. 2.16. againſt Gods Sabbaths, rather then the 4th Com. Exod. 20.8. for Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths; he chooſeth conſequences before Scripture; collections before Gods expreſſe vvord; and preferreth mans blind reaſon, before Gods expreſſe vvill and pleſure: I deſire the Chriſtian
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21140:85"/>Reader, to marke this laſt paſſage, vvith double and treble dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: for in all my booke, there is hardly any thing of greater conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: the ſumme vvhereof is this, that menes collections, reaſons, &amp; conſequences, made out of ſome text of ſcripture, are not of that diuine nature &amp; infallibility, that they ſhould coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand &amp; ouerturne an expreſſe Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of Almightie God. And this is the very caſe, betvvixt my aduerſaries &amp; mee: for, I bring an expreſſe Commandement, for the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths; and againſt them, they bring nothing elſe, but their ovvne reaſons, collections, &amp; conſequences fetcht out of this text, Col. 2.17. &amp; vnneceſſarily fetcht alſo.</p>
                     <p>Thus by the comparing of theſe two textes of Scripture to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it appeareth to euery eye, that whoſoeuer refuſeth the Lords Sabbaths, vpon that text Col. 2.16. rather then em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth them, from this text Exod. 20.8. hee preferreth weake &amp; inſufficient arguments, before able &amp; ſtrong arguments: the which whoſoeuer doeth, after fufficient notice giuen him, he bewraieth that he loueth not Gods law in trueth of heart, &amp; for it ſelfe, but out of by reſpectes: for, by his preferring this weake text Col. 2.16. before that ſtrong text Exod. 20.8. he ouerturneth &amp; raſeth to the grownd, a parte of Gods law: &amp; who can ouerthrow a parte of Gods law, &amp; yet loue Gods law? Suppoſe we that the Title of A Miniſters Liuing, or of any mans Inheritance, were to be tried, &amp; he could ſhew but as good Euidence for it, as the 4th com. is for the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths; thinke you he would feare to leeſe the day, to one that eould ſhevv no better Euidence, then is the text Coloſ. 2.16. againſt the Lords Sabbaths? no vndoubtedly: or, ſuppoſe we the Title of A Miniſters liuing, or of any mans Inheritance, were to be tried, &amp; there were 2. Kinds of Euidence at his choiſe to pleade, the one as ſtrong as the 4th comand. is for the Lords Sabbaths; the other as weake as the text. Col. 2.16. is againſt the Lords Sabbaths; if novv this Miniſter, or other perſon, vvould make choiſe of this weaker Euidence Col. 2.16. vvould not euery man ſay, ſurely this Miniſter or this other partie, care not for their Liuing or Inheritance, they doe not loue them? iuſt ſo, it is an argument that men loue not Gods Law,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:21140:86"/>nor his Sabbaths therin commanded, vvhen they vvill parte vvith them ſo eaſily &amp; ſo growndleſly: it is a ſigne they are vnvvilling to know &amp; acknovvledge the vnknovvne partes of Gods Law, vvhen they goe thus partially to vvorke, in the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the point: did men loue Gods lavv, aboue Gold &amp; Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as did <hi>David,</hi> they vvould not parte vvith his commanded Sabbaths, ſo lightly: a man ſhall find ſomething to doe to vvring mens gold &amp; ſiluer from them; but for Gods Sabbaths, you ſhall haue them from them, vvith out ſtrife; vvhere then is the loue to Gods Sabbaths, vvhere is the loue vnto Gods lawes? Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters &amp; people may ſay &amp; talke much, &amp; make them ſelues &amp; others beleeue, that they ſtand for Gods lavves, &amp; loue his commandements; but let them ſelues &amp; all men iudge, vvhither they ſpeake truly or not, by this marke: is this a loue to Gods Lavv, to ouerthrovv a parte of it, vvhich vvas euer vnderſtood by all the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, of the weekly Sabbaths, by a text Col. 2.16. vvhich doth neither mention the vveekly Sabbaths at all, nor yet ſpeake of all Sabbaths generally, ſo as the vveekly Sabbaths muſt be included neceſſarily? this is to ſupplant a certainty, by a text which is doubtfull &amp; vncertaine, is this loue? Thus much of the firſt vvay, vvherby men bevvray theire regardleſneſſe &amp; theire vnvvillingneſſe, to be taught &amp; inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the perfection of the lavv, &amp; in the vnkowne partes, ther of; &amp; that by prefering vveake arguments, before able &amp; ſtrong arguments.</p>
                     <p>The 2d vvay vvherby men bevvray theire vnvvillingneſse, to be inſtructed in the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lavv, &amp; in the vnknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne partes thereof is, in that they admit of inſufficient &amp; diſallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wable <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> for the triall of the point: that this is ſo, is plaine by this, that all people vvell nigh put all theire truſt&amp; confidence for the triall of this point, in theire <hi>Miniſters,</hi> ſaying our Miniſters ſay, the 7th day Sabbath, commanded in the 4th com. is a Ceremony, &amp; aboliſhed; &amp; they are men of lern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; honeſt godly men; &amp; therefore we reſt in them; &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonvvce the Sabbath day, though it be commanded by God in the 4th com: they haue ſtudied the point, &amp; they are a multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of them, &amp; this contenteth mee: I knovv they durſt not ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21140:86"/>othervviſe then they thinke, they be ſuch godly holy men &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſſe, <hi>the prieſts lipps ſhould preſerue knowledge, &amp; they ſhould ſeeke the law at his mouth</hi> Mal. 2.7. &amp; therfore I haue hitherto adviſed people, to repaire to theire Miniſters, for direction &amp; information in this point; but vpon better aduiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I ſhall recant that, I vvill doe ſo no more: for; I finde theire Teſtimonyes, &amp; affirmations, &amp; proteſtations, in this point falſe: tis true, the Prieſts lippes ſhould of right preſerue knovvleg, but I find they doe deſtroy knowledg; it may be ſaied of them, as the Lord ſaied of thoſe Prieſts. <hi>But yee are gone out of the way; yee haue cauſed many to fall by the law:</hi> Mal. 2.8. iuſt ſo, our Miniſters novv a dayes, if the people goe to them for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in this 4th com. they ſhall haue deſtruction; the lavv ſhall be ſo expounded as they will cauſe men to fall by the lavv, ſaying the lavv commandeth the Lords day for Sabbath, &amp; not the 7th day, vvhich is as falſe as falſe can be. 2. I finde theire Teſtimony inſufficient, &amp; therefore, I ſhall no more aduiſe peopleto take theire Miniſters counſaile in this matter.</p>
                     <p>I come then to ſhevv the inſufficiency, of our Miniſters Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony; In an approued &amp; alovvable teſtimony, 3. things are required the vvant of any one vvhereof doth nullify the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as all Diuines vvill confeſſe: the firſt is <hi>wiſedome,</hi> for hovv can he be thought to giue a right &amp; true verdict, that is ignorant? the 2d is, <hi>honeſty,</hi> for hovv can vve hope he ſhould giue a true verdict, that is diſhoneſt? the 3d is <hi>Good will,</hi> for hovv can vve expect, that he ſhould ſpake that trueth vvhich he knovveth, vvhich is an enemy to it? this euill will to the cauſe, wil not permit him to vtter his, knowledge, to the furtherance of it: or if he doth ſpeake it, he wil deliuer it in ſuch equiuocall &amp; doubtfull words &amp; manner, as a man ſhall be neuer the better for it.</p>
                     <p>For the 2d of theſe properties, to wite, <hi>honesty</hi> (for I wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine with the ſecond) I grant it to be in our Miniſters; be it they be all godly &amp; religiouſe, yet this is but one of the properties of a vvarrantable Teſtimony. Neuertheleſſe, becauſe many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple plead much the honeſty of their Miniſters, ſaying, they
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21140:87"/>are godly, holy, &amp; very zealouſe men &amp;c. for my parte, if I could be moued to queſtion theire honeſtie, here is cauſe enough: for what greater cauſe can there be, to moue one to ſuſpect theire zeale to be ignorance, &amp; their holineſſe to be hollovvneſſe &amp; &amp; fained, then to heare them ſpeake or diſpute againſt Gods word, &amp; ordinance, &amp; againſt an expreſſe com. in the morall law? a man wold thinke, that man can not be ſound at the core &amp; heart, that dares oppoſe god, &amp; that vnneceſſarily: the which they doe, that oppoſe his commanded Sabbaths.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt of theſe properties, to wit, <hi>wiſedome:</hi> I graunt they haue wiſedome &amp; learning enough to vnderſtand this point; but haue they employed this their wiſedome &amp; learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the impartiall ſerch of this point, for the finding of it out? for take a wiſe &amp; learned mans teſtimony in any Arte, or in any point about Druinity, wherein he is not ſtudied, &amp; he is like an vnlerned man; as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when his Lockes were cut, he was weake like an other man: Now be it that they haue neuer ſo much learning, &amp; wiſedome, yet ſince they haue not imployed theire wiſdome &amp; learning for the finding out of this point what auaileth it that they are wiſe &amp; lerned? for in this matter, they are neither wiſe, nor learned; becauſe they haue vſed neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this ſtudy: that this is ſo, appeareth from theire own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for ſome, &amp; of the very chiefe &amp; principall of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue confeſſed vnto mee, &amp; others vnto my frends who haue related it truly to mee, that they haue ſaied that they haue ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died indeed to maintaine A Sabbath day, out of the 4th com. but whither it ſhould be vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 7 day; or the 8th day, on the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or on the Sunday, this point neuer came into their minds to ſtudy it: well then, if it hath not bene ſtudied by the chiefe of them, that haue bone the moſt ſtudious &amp; ſerching, it muſt be yeelded, that the reſidue of them, haue much more ouerskipt it: tell me then, if the ſayings of theſe men, againſt this point of the Lords Sabbaths, be to be regarded; when as it is a point, vvhich never ſo much as came in to their minds to ſtudy it: Let people no more boaſt of the vviſdome &amp; lerning of theire Miniſters then, nor yet of theire Multitud &amp;c. &amp; that they all whith one voice, haue cried out &amp; ſpake againſt the Lords Sabbaths, as
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21140:87"/>ceremonies; can a blind man iudge of cullers? or a wiſe man ſpeake of what he is ignorant of let people no more therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the wiſdome &amp; lerning of their Miniſters in this point; but let them imitate thoſe noble <hi>Bereans</hi> Act. 17. Let them ſerch the Scriptures daily, to ſee if theſe things I tender vnto them, be ſo or no: and this is one cauſe, vvhy I reiect the verdict of our Miniſters in this point, becauſe it wanteth one of the properties of a warrantable teſtimony, to vvit, the vſe of their wiſdome &amp; lerning: &amp; hereby it appeareth alſo, vpon what poore grownds, our common people haue hither to gone, in relying their ſoules in this matter, vpon their Miniſters zeale, holineſſe, &amp; learning; vvhat if they be neuer ſo zealous, holy, pure, &amp; lerned, it is but a zeale vvithout knowledge, vvhich ſpeaketh of things not ſoundly ſtudied.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I come to the 3d property, namely <hi>good will:</hi> this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of a warrantable teſtimony our Miniſters want; for they haue no good vvill at all to the cauſe, but all euill vvill that may be; witneſſe all their words and deedes in &amp; about this matter: if a man hath a cauſe to be tried before the Iudge, by 12 Iury men; if he ſuſpecteth ſome one of the 12, to be his enemy, they ſay, it is lawfull for him to except againſt that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that cauſe; &amp; the Iudge vvill cauſe that man to be drawne, and an other to be ſvvorne in his roome: vvhich declareth, that a man ſuſpected to haue no good will, is not eſteemed a ſit man to determine of a controuercy: Now that there is cauſe for vs to ſuſpect moſt Miniſters to haue euill vvill to this cauſe of Gods Sabbaths, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth 1. by their vvords and deeds to the contrary: among others, let thoſe many ſlaunders, &amp; reprochfull ſpeeches, and hard vſages, which they haue vſed againſt mee, for defending this cauſe of Gods, let theſe I ſay teſtify whither they be friends or enemies to the cauſe. 2. There is great cauſe to ſuſpect they will be no friends to the cauſe; becauſe all their liues long hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, they haue taught the people to the contrary, to vvit, that the 7th day Sabbath is aboliſhed: and if novv they ſhould be friends to this cauſe, they muſt vnteach vvhat they haue taught, and this they cannot beare: for ſo the people (as ſome of them haue ſaied) would neuer beleeue them againe; this is ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21140:88"/>as they that haue euer liued in credit, and neuer denied themſelues, in ſuch a point as this, cannot tell how to beare it; &amp; therfore can beare no good will to the cauſe. 3. That they ſhould receiue this point from ſo vile and contemptible a perſon as firſt brocheth it, this cannot be borne: it cannot be thought, their high ſpirits will ſtoope ſo lovve. 4. That the profeſſion of this trueth, may endanger them the loſſe of their faire liuings. 5. It croſſeth ſuppoſed Antiquity. 6. It croſſeth vniuerſality. 7. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be reformed. Theſe &amp; the like raigning &amp; ruling in their mindes, how can it be but ſuſpitious that they haue no good will to the cauſe? why then ſhould it not be lavvfull for me, to except againſt theſe mens teſtimony, to haue them dravvne, ſo as they may paſſe no verdict touching the Lords Sabbaths? For their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony is quit diſabled, as you ſee, &amp; therefore to be reiected.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, parties vve ſay are no fit Iudges: Novv Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in this caſe are parties: for, they are violent againſt the Lords Sabbaths; vvherefore they are no compitent Iudges: if therefore people vvill haue any knovvledge of this part of Gods Lavv, they muſt get it themſelues, by their owne ſtudy of the point: they muſt ſerch my bookes for Gods Sabbaths, and their bookes &amp; ſermons againſt Gods Sabbaths; &amp; vnpartially weigh the arguments on both ſids, vvithout any regard had at all to the Authours.</p>
                     <p>Thus youſee, that if a man hath knowledge of this trueth, &amp; hath Honeſtie alſo, yet if his goodwill be wanting his opinion &amp; iudgment is of no worth: yet fruther I argue, if that a mans teſtimony be worth leſſe, for want of <hi>goodwill</hi> to the cauſe, when as he once by wiſdome knovveth the trueth firſt; then much more worth leſſe is it, when he was ſtuffed with a preiudice of the point before he knew it, that is, when he had euill vvill to the point before he knew it: novv this is the caſe of our Miniſters, as may be coniectured by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of thoſe 7. argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned: for at theire very firſthearſay of the point, before they had read the booke, or ſtudied the point, thes ſtumbling blockes appeared inſtantly, to vvit, if they imbrace it, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovveth loſſe of credit, loſſe of liuing, &amp; the reſt; ſo as theire minds are ſo foreſtalled vvith feares of theſe dangers, as they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21140:88"/>cannot regard vvhat they heare, nor vvhat they read; their iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement is quite ouerthrovvne for the moſt part: &amp; in this caſe, ſay that they reade the booke about the pointe, they reade ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvith a minde deſirouſe to carpe &amp; cavvill at euery thing, as ioyfull to make falſe, vvhat they feare to imbrace; rather then to be further inlightened in the point, as I appeale to theire conſciences, if I ſay not true of them: further, the trueth hereof appeareth, that theire minds &amp; iudgements are foreſtaled, againſt this point, before they reade or ſtudy the point: for, many Miniſters, yea the moſt who neuer ſtudied the point, no nor euer ſavv ſo much as the out ſide of my former booke, yet at the firſt heareſay of it, cry burne the booke, &amp; the like: wherfore, if people ſhall ſay, I, but novv our Miniſters haue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtudied the point, they haue ſeene &amp; redd his booke, &amp; are yet as violent againſt it as before &amp;c. vvhy vvhat maruaile, ſeing they ſet vpon readinge it, vvith a foreſtaled opinion? they reſolued by reading it, to get no good by it, but to ſee vvhere it vvas vveake in theire conceit, &amp; ſo to blaze that a broad: for they vvant that propertie of an allovvable witneſſe, to vvit, <hi>goodwill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And vvhat though people ſay, their Miniſters are many, who are of the ſame minde? for the opinions of 10000. of them, are not worth a ruſh in this caſe: the opinion of ſome one Miniſter, who ſpeaketh for the Lords Sabbath, with hazard to looſe his liuing, and credit, with the reſt, is more to be eſteemed and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the people I auowch it, then is the opinions of 10000. Miniſters, who ſpeake againſt the Lords Sabbaths, not daring to doe otherwiſe, for feare of loſſe of liuing, credit, and thoſe other diſcommodities forementioned; the Teſtimony of one Martyr, is of more worth, then of all his perſecutors: for the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe many, is to be ſuſpected, to ſpeake for their prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit rather then for a good conſcience, but the witneſſe of that one, is to be thought to ſpeake rather for his conſcience, then for his proffit. Wherefore if people vvil be led by the iudgment of others rather then by themſelues; or if they will leane any thing at all to other mens iudgments, let them chooſe to follow the opinion of him that looſeth by his iudgment, rather then of them who make againe by their opinion</p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:21140:89"/>
                     <p> That this point may be yet cleerer, ſee what a power carnall feare hath ouer a good conſcience: in the dayes of Chriſt, it is ſaied Ioh. 12.42. <hi>Neuertheleſſe among the chiefe Rulers, many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in him; but becauſe of the phariſes they did not confeſse him, leſt they ſhould be caſt out of the Synagogue:</hi> loe here what a carnall feare vvill doe, it can make men afraide to ſpeake and confeſſe, what they belecue is a trueth! the feare of being excommunicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, made them that they durſt not confeſſe Chriſt him ſelfe: you know alſo, how ſome of the Martyres through feare, haue for a ſeaſon denied the trueth: you know alſo, how <hi>Peter,</hi> through feare denied his Lord &amp; Maſter, yea and forſwore him too: wherefore, be it that Miniſters haue vviſedome &amp; lerning &amp; doe know this trueth; be it alſo, that they be godly &amp; make conſcience; why all this may be, &amp; yet of feare they may deny Gods trueth when they doe know it; &amp; alſo much ſooner, of feare they may refuſe to learne to knovv this trueth, vvhen it is tendred them: for Peter knew Chriſt, &amp; Peter was a godly Miniſter alſo, and made conſcience: &amp; ſo the Martyres, &amp; yet you ſee how farr feare to diſpleaſe men, &amp; feare of damage may preuaile.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration therfore, of theſe many ſtumbling blockes in the way of Miniſters, whereof they cannot be ignorant, ſhould me thinke ſtrike them vvith a feare, that they ſpeake partially and corruptly, vvhen they ſpeake againſt the Lords Sabbaths; knowing how eaſy a thing it is, for mens minds to be foreſtaled with a preiudice, when a point is tendred vnto them, attended with ſo many diſcommodities as this is; I wiſh they would ſtay vpon the meditation of this point a while, that it may doe them good.</p>
                     <p>Now as for people, ſince they haue heard at large, how inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient the opinion &amp; iudgement of their Miniſters is, vvhilſt they ſpeake againſt the Lords Sabbathes, if hereafter they will ſtill cleaue, vnto their iudgments for the tryall of this trueth, they ſhall bewray their vnwillingneſſe to be inſtructed in the integrity &amp; perfection of Gods Law, &amp; conſequently, that they loue not the Lavv of God in trueth. Yea, a vvorſe matter; they bewray that they make Idoles of their Miniſters, equalling them
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21140:89"/>to God, if not aduancing them aboue God: for many people, yea zealouſe profeſſoures, doe ſet more by what their Miniſters ſay, then by what God himſelfe ſaieth: for God ſaith expreſly in that Morall Law, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to ſanctify it.</hi> No ſaith the Miniſter, you muſt not Sanctify it: &amp; to culler his ſpeech, he cales and miſcales it a ceremony &amp; Iewiſh &amp;c. now of theſe two, that is, of God or the Miniſter, who is obeied? are not the Miniſters words regarded, &amp; Gods word neglected? who cold thinke, that men profeſſing godlineſſe, ſhould ſo ſleight their God?</p>
                     <p>Did men loue Gods Lavv, aboue gold and ſiluer, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did; and did they account it as their inheritance, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did; they would neuer hazard the loſſe of any portion of it, vpon ſuch ſleity ſhiftes as theſe, to ſay our Miniſters ſpeake againſt it: And our Miniſters ſay it is a ceremony, &amp; the like: vvhen the Title of A mans Inheritance is in queſtion, be it that one Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer ſaith his title is not good, yet the Heire will not ſo reſt in his iudgment, but he will try an other: &amp; if an hundreth Counſailers ſhould tell him one after an other, that his Title is naught, yet if among them all, but ſome one whom he thinketh an honeſt man, ſhould tell him his Title is ſound &amp; good; would not hee retaine him for his Counſailer, &amp; cleaue vnto his iudgment? ſo, if you were in loue with the wayes and Lawes of God, though an hundreth Miniſters ſhould all ſpeak againſt them, or againſt any branch or portion of them: you would reiect them all, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting theire zeale, holineſſe, &amp; iudgments, that dare ſpeake againſt any of Gods Lawes, &amp; you would cleaue vnto that one, who ſpeaketh for God, &amp; for his Lawes.</p>
                     <p>There remaineth yet two vſes more, to be made of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, to loue Gods Law: the former is this; is it ſo, that thou doeſt loue Gods Law, then thou vvilt euer more ſide it, &amp; take parte, not onely vvith ſuch partes of Gods Lavv, as are alredy infalliblie knowne vnto thee to be partes therof; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thou wilt take parte with ſuch partes of Gods Lavv, as are but ſuſpected by common preſumptiones, to be partes of the ſame: as if there be but probabilites, coniecturall hopes; &amp; liklihoods of it: thus an Heire vvill doe vvith his Inheritance, if any man
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21140:90"/>ſhall informe him after he is come to his Lands, that in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſuch an Acre of Land is percell of his Inheritance, he vvill redily imbrace this nevvſe, forthvvith he vvill ſerch his Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, &amp; he vvill to Counſaile vpon this intelligence, and if there remaine but a poſſibility or probale liklihood that it may be his, he will to Law for it, &amp;c.

                     <p>Let vs apply this then; the Lords Sabbaths on the Saturday, are a parte of Gods lavv, &amp; plaine enough too if men had minds to ſee; but becauſe of theire vnwillingeneſſe to ſide it vvith god, for his Sabbaths, therfore we muſt heere ſuppoſe the matter doubtfull, vvhere no doubt is, &amp; but probable, coniecturall, &amp; likly: that Gods Sabbaths, are things probable, coniecturall, &amp; likly to be in force, I thus make it good; 1. becauſe they ſtand vvritten &amp; in rouled, among the Moralles, in the Decalogue 2. becauſe all the other 9. commandements, vvhich vvere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21140:90"/>Citties, ſaue London, or Norwich: 3. it is likly &amp; probable that the Lords Sabbaths are ours, becauſe, they were once in the poſſeſſion of our Aunceſtores, the primitiue Churches, who kept the Saturday Sabbath, for 300. or 400. yeeres together after Chriſts Aſcention. 4. there is ſome probability in it, in that ſome one man (as my ſelfe) doth ſtand vp to defend the Lords Sabbaths: let but any one man in a County, riſe vp, &amp; informe for theking, and forth vvith the Iudges of Aſſiſe will admit his information, and Counſaile ſhall plead for the cauſe: albeit the Iudges, nor happely, hardly any in the whole County, doe know the matter to be ſo, beſids the Informer and one or tvvo more with him: ſo then, the information by one ſingle man, may make the matter probable and likly to be true. It is a cleere caſe then, that by common preſumptions, it is not leſſe then likly, that the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath, is a parte of Gods Lavv belonging vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>Is it ſo, vvhat remaineth then, but that vve exhorte and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvade men euery vvhere, to ſide it, and to take parte vvith this parte of Gods Lavv, touching Gods Sabbath, whenſoeuer it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto triall, or into controuercy; but neuer to oppoſe it, or to take vp armes againſt it: to this end, let me propound vnto you ſondry reaſons and Motiues, as 1. the Law of God, with all the partes therof, are the <hi>Inheritance</hi> of the Church Deut. 33.4. and ſo <hi>David</hi> made it his Inheritance Pſal. 119.111. and our <hi>Church</hi> vvherof we are members, hath alſo taken this law, to be our Inheritance, as hath bene ſhowne: now a man were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, if he vvould not ſide it vvith him ſelfe, and take part in defence of that which is his owne; the law of God, it is our owne, in aſmuch as we haue a ſhare in it as in a common Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, being we are members of the Church; yet behould hovv vnnaturall many men are, both Miniſters, and people! if Gods Sabbaths come into queſtion, they all forſake them, like as the Diſciples did Chriſt, when he vvas apprehended: nay vvorſe, they turne enemies vnto them, they nickname them reprochfully, and ſmite them with the tounge, calling them Iuiſh, &amp; Iudaiſme, and ceremonies, &amp; ſhaddowes: vvhy be it that this parte of Gods law, touching his Sabbaths, be not certainly knowne vnto thee, to belong vnto thee, only
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21140:91"/>thou haſt but ſome probabilities, coniectures, &amp; common preſumptions that it doth belong vnto thee; yet, if thou doeſt not improue all theſe probable arguments, and manage theſe common coniectures and preſumptiones, to the vtmoſt for god and for his Sabbaths, it bewraieth, that thou art not ſo faith full, in executing the vvill of thy god, as many Excecutors are in execution of the vvill of theire deceaſed friend: for they vvil omit no debt that they can haue any inkling of; but thou baſt notice of a debt of the Sabbath day, owing to god, and yet vvilt not ſide it vvith god, nor improue theſe tidings to the vtmoſt, in behalfe of thy god. It bevvraieth alſo, that thou takeſt not Gods law to be thine Inheritance: for if thoudidſt, thou couldeſt not ſit ſtill in ſilence, when thou haſt notice brought thee, that ſome moitie and portion therof is vvrongfully detained from thee.</p>
                     <p>A 2d motiue is, becauſe a mans taking in vvith Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, vvill declare him to be a friend to the lavv of god: euery man would be eſteemed a frend vnto Gods lavv: well then, let it appeare thou atte ſo indeed and not in name only, by taking in with this parte of Gods lavv, which commandeth the Saturday Sabbath: vſe thy wites, imploy thy ſtudy, thy toung, thy frends, and vvhat thou canſt for the furtherance of this part of Gods lavv, concerning his Sabbath: The Lords 7th day Sabbath, it is loſt, as vvas the vvomans Groate luk: 15.8. ſhe had 10. groates, and hauing loſt but one of the 10. ſhee neuer leaues ſweeping and ſeeking till ſhee hath found it; ſo ſhould we for this one command, loſt from the 10. if a man hath an 100. ſheepe, &amp; looſeth but one of them (ſaith our Sauiour) he leaueth the nynty and nyne in the vvilderneſſe, &amp; goeth after that one, vntill he find it Luk: 25.4. ſo ſhould we take more paines and care &amp; ſtudy, to regaine this Command, touching the Lords Sabbaths, then after all the other nyne, and an halfe: but how can they be eſteemed frends to Gods lavv, vvho ſide it, vvith thoſe, that ſide it againſt Gods Sabbaths?</p>
                     <p>A 3d motiue is from the worth and excellency of Gods Law: the Prophet Dauid telleth vs, that it is to be loued <hi>aboue gold, yea aboue moſt fine gold,</hi> Pſ. 119.127. and it was vnto him, <hi>better
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21140:91"/>then thowſands of gold and ſiluer,</hi> Pſ. 119.72. if therfore thou knoweſt not the price and vvorth of Gods Law, &amp; the Sabbaths therin commanded, learne it of <hi>Dauid</hi> who knew the value of it, it is better then gold and ſiluer; yea, as good, <hi>as all riches</hi> put together, Pſ. 119.14. no man vvill be an enemy to gold &amp; to ſiluer; be not thou then an enemy to Gods Sabbaths; for they are better then thowſands of gold and ſiluer, we may beleene the Prophet Dauid: euery man vvill be a frend vnto riches, why be thou a frend then vnto Gods Sabbaths, for they are as good <hi>as all riches</hi> in the vvorld.</p>
                     <p>A 4th motiue to ſtirr the vp to ſide it with Gods Sabbaths, is becauſe in ſo doeing, thou ſhalt ſide it, &amp; take parte with God himſelfe: for the 7th day Sabbaths, they are Gods; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he calleth them his, ſaying, <hi>mine holy day,</hi> Iſa. 58.13. and <hi>the 7th day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God,</hi> Exo. 20.10. &amp;, they are Gods becauſe God commanded them, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day,</hi> Exod. 20.8. whoſoeuer therfore taketh parte with the Lords Sabbaths, hee taketh parte with God alſo, whoſe thoſe Sabbaths are: it is vſuall vvith God &amp; man, to take that as done to them ſelues, which is done to that which by way of excellency they call theires: euery man vvould be glad to take parte vvith God (they ſay) al though it were againſt all the world; for God is ſtrongeſt, &amp; wiſeſt, &amp; able to reward a man well for his paines, &amp; his fauour is better then liefe; well then, ſtand for Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, for they are Gods, and ſo thou ſhalt take in with God, &amp; fight vnder his Banner. But woe to that man that oppoſeth Gods Sabbaths; for as the other bewraieth him ſelfe to be a friend of Gods, ſo this, bewraieth him ſelfe to be an enemy to God, and God wil deſtoy all his fees. If this argument vvill not auaile with men I know not what will; if they had rather take parte with men, againſt God &amp; that which is Gods; then with God &amp; that which is Gods, againſt men, then let them goe on; if it goe vvell with ſuch, I ſhall not care how I liue heere. It is houlden good pollicy, to ſide it with the ſtrongeſt, for my parte I know none ſtronger then God, I will therfore ſide it with him; For thats the ſafeſt: vvherefore, I haue reſolued vpon it, to take parte with Gods Sabbaths, and with them to liue, and to dye.</p>

                     <p> The 5th &amp; laſt motiue ſhall be from the conſideration of the Title whoſe it is; &amp; this is to be regarded, for if the Title in controuercy, be but a common mans, then to oppoſe it, is but common danger; but if it be the Title of a King, then men had need take heed how they take parts againſt it: ſo the Title of the Sabbaths, now in controuercy, to be tried; if they were called mans Sabbaths, &amp; of mans inſtitution, then to oppoſe them the danger were not ſo great: But theſe Sabbaths are called Gods Sabbaths, of his inſtitution; therfore the Title here is not mans, but Gods, the King of kings: here then take heed if euer thou tookeſt heed hovv thou oppoſe Gods Title: if a father hath the Title of his land, in triall before the Iudge, though the baſtard regardeth not whither he wine or looſe, becauſe he knoweth that he ſhall neuer inherit; yet the true borne ſonne, wiſheth in his heart, that his fathers Title may haue the day, ſo long as he ſeeth there is a probability that it is his fathers: So doubtleſſe, euery true borne ſonne of God, cannot but wiſh from his heart, that the Title of God his father, touching his Sabbaths may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, rather then goe downe: but he that regardeth not which end goeth forward, as we ſay, he bewraieth himſelfe to be no ſonne, but a baſtard; but he that not onely regardeth not which end goeth forvvard, but vvhich is farre vvorſe, turneth himſelfe enemy to his fathers Title, inſomuch as he dareth with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent face diſpute, and openly in Court plead againſt, and in pulpit preach againſt his fathers Title, what a one he bewraieth himſelfe to be, I haue no names bad enough to giue him.</p>
                     <p>If an informer cometh into the Court, &amp; informeth for the King, albeit the Court knovveth not hovv he is able to make good &amp; proue his information, yet it being a matter probable, ſeeing it is the Kings cauſe, both the Iudge and all the Iuſtices, euen the whole Court, doe countenance the cauſe: yea &amp; ſo farre forth take in vvith it, as that if it be poſſible, ſo as no iniuſtice be done, nor any Lavv of the Realme thereby violated, he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth for the King, ſhall haue the day, rather then a priuate ſubiect; and good reaſon for it: Well, in the caſe of the Lords Sabbaths, I informe for the King of kings, the King of heauen &amp; earth; it is novv the parte of all Gods Miniſters, both ſuperiour
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:21140:92"/>as <hi>Biſhops,</hi> &amp; inferiour as common <hi>Preachers,</hi> to take in with this cauſe of Gods Sabbaths, as Gods cauſe, their Lord &amp; King; &amp; to countenance it to their vtmoſt; yea, ſo farre forth to backe it, &amp; take part vvith it, as Gods Sabbaths may haue the day, if no law of God, nor text in Scripture, be thereby violated, as I dare pawne my life for it, there ſhall not. If Miniſters in the Church, both ſuperiours and inferiours, doe not thus honour God before the people, by giuing his cauſe the preeminence; the Magiſtrates of the common weale, ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt them, &amp; condemne them.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the laſt vſe of the point; Is it ſo, that thou loueſt the lavv of God; then take vp a daily lamentation, for the lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; imperfection of Gods lavv; for the vveekly violation of Gods 4th com. and for the profanation of Gods Sabbaths; if we haue not Gods Law, in its integrity, and perfection, as we haue not, if vve vvant his Sabbath therein commanded, then haue vve but a lame &amp; imperfect lavv; and if the Saturday be Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as I haue ſhovvne it is, and ſhall further proue hereafter, then is the 4th com. vveekly broken, and Gods Sabbaths week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profaned.</p>
                     <p>As Dauid hath bene our Preſident, ſhevving vs hovv vve ſhould loue Gods law; ſo let him be our Preſident, to ſhevv vs hovv vve ſhould mourne for the violation &amp; tranſgreſſion of Gods Lavv: <hi>Mine eyes guſh out</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>with riuers of waters, becauſe they keepe not thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.136. And againe, <hi>I ſaw the tranſgreſſours, &amp; was grieued, becauſe they kept not thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119.158. It is a property then of a Godly man, to mourne, and to grieue, to ſee Gods Lavvs tranſgreſſed; and the reaſon of that his ſorrow &amp; griefe, is becauſe he loueth Gods Law, as Dauid did: Oh then that all ſorts of people, would bevvray their loue to Gods Lavv, by their ſorrow of heart, to ſee it tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed weekly, in the profanation of Gods Sabbaths? Againe, &amp; doeſt thou indeed loue the Lavv of God? how canſt thou but take it to heart, to ſee this holy and Diuine Lavv of thy God ſo mangled &amp; defaced, ſo lame &amp; imperfect, as in theſe dayes it is, in all Chriſtian Churches?

                     <p>Tis true, we keepe theſe Oracles intirly in the letter, ſo doe Papiſtes; but vvhats the letter, when we weaken diminiſh and aboliſh the binding force of it? for vve ſay, this parte of Gods Oracles, <hi>(But the 7th day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou ſhalt not doe any worke)</hi> doth not bind vs Chriſtians: <hi>In it,</hi> that is, in it 7th day, thou ſhalt not vvorke, ſaith God: I but this prohibition bindeth not novv ſay ſome Miniſters: no? vvhat

                     <p> Greate cauſe we haue to lament: for, 1. the Sacred &amp; holy day, vvhich is of greateſt antiquity, is profaned; this Holy day, being as ancient, as the vvorld it ſelfe, Geneſ. 2.3. ſecondly, the moſt honourable Holy day, is vnhallovved; For God him ſelfe made it an holy day, by bleſſing it, and ſanctifying it, Geneſ. 2.3. Yea, and God himſelfe reſted on it, Geneſ. 2.2.3. Therfore it is two vvaies honourable. 3.

                     <p>And is not this to be lamented, when people neglect their proffites, &amp; commodites on the Lords day; ſome looſe their Corne, ſome their Hay, many poore men, their labour and vvorke wherby they maintaine their families; vvith many other loſſes and damages to their eſtates, which might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned vp; and all theſe the vvell minded people of the land, doe vvillingly neglect and looſe, &amp; all in hope of theſe promiſes; truſting to make a better exchang, that for loſſe of erthly things in conſcience to Gods Command. they ſhall gaine heauenly things, and intereſt into Gods promiſes: but behould, they muſt faile of the promiſes, becauſe they faile God in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: for Gods promiſes rune thus, if thou performe the condition, which is to Sanctify the day named Sabbath day, not the day named Lords day: tell me novv, is not this matter of iuſt lamentation, to ſee the people of the land, thus beguiled
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21140:95"/>and deceiued, and that both in their temporall eſtate, &amp; alſo of the promiſſes of God? if men haue any compaſſion &amp; bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue in them, they cannot but ſorrow and mourne for theſe things.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, as for thoſe forementioned Curſes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Sabbath day, and the profaners of it: vvheras our people hope to auoide them, by a religiouſe ſanctifying of the Lords day; behould, the people to be pittied! for all that, they fale into the danger of theſe Curſes; becauſe they profane that very day, named Sabbath day, vnto the profanation of vvhich, theſe curſes vvere poperly made: for theſe curſes, were neuer made vnto the profanation of the day named Lords day, or vnto the day nicknamed &amp; counterfeitly called Sabbathday, as now the Lords day is: for theſe curſes were threatened long before euer the Lords day, had any being, or could be kept for a Sabbath day, if it had euer ſo bene kept: as for their religiouſe ſanctifying of the Lords day in conſcience of this 4th com. God may ſay vnto them, who required it at your hands? &amp; is not this alſo matter of iuſt lamentation, to ſee well minded people, ſtriue and endeauor with greate dilligence, to auoide Gods Curſes, and yet by reaſon of miſeinformation, &amp; corrupt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to fale into danger of them? yea, it is the more pittifull, in that the ſelfe ſame labour &amp; deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, had they bene performed both on the day before, they had for certaine, &amp; out of all doubt, both bene liable to all the promiſſes, made to them that keepe Gods Sabbaths; and alſo bene freed from the leaſt danger of the Curſes, threatened to ſuch as breake the Lords Sabbaths.</p>
                     <p>The 6th and laſt cauſe of lamentation, is to ſee the prieſts of the Lord, of all men, Gods Miniſters, turne enemies to Gods Law: for they vvill needs vvithout any neceſſity at all, make ſomthing in Gods Law ceremoniall and ſo aboliſhed, Iudaicall &amp; ſo to be hated; they cannot abide that Gods 10. command. ſhould be like a chaine of 10. linkes, all of pure gold, one linke as vvell as an other: but though all the 9. be pure gold, yet ſome one of the 10. muſt be partly gold partly leade; partly morall partly ceremoniall, as if ſnovv could be partly vvhite partly blake; or a ſhadovv and ceremony placed in the hearte of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21140:95"/>a morall Lavv! thus they make Gods Lavv, like vnto Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kadnezzars Image, which he ſavve in his dreame, Dan. 2.32. partly gold, and partly clay: ſurely this their fiction is but a dreame, Gods Lavv muſt be morall in euery iot and Title of it, it muſt be all gold or none gold, all clay or none clay: but our Miniſters will be partiall in the Lavv; they will not endure it to be morall in all the partes therof; they are enemies to the integrity &amp; perfection of it: that ſervants ſhould not take parte with the commandements of their Maiſters, but oppoſe them; that children ſhould not take parte with the command. of their fathers, but turne enemies to them; that ſubiects ſhould not take in vvith their King to defend his Lavves, but ſet them ſelues againſt them; it is vndutifulneſſe, diſloyaltie, and rebellion; but that Miniſters, whom God hath taken ſo neere vnto him, as to make them of his Counſaile; and to make it their proper office to defend his Lavves, &amp; to this end hath allowed them large maintenance as the Tyeth of the Realme &amp;c. that theſe kinde of men, ſhould refuſe to defend his Lavv, and turne enemies vnto it in whole or in parte, what ſhould I ſay? it is high tyme the world were at an end: as the Sabbath is Gods ordinance, ſo the Decalogue is Gods Law: novv were men profeſſed enemies to God, then if they ſhould doe what in them lieth, to aboliſh his Sabbaths, &amp; to reiect as much of his Law as poſſiblie they could with any colour deviſe, it were but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their profeſſion; but that wee, who are profeſſed friends to God and to his Lavv, &amp; therfore ſhould imbrace as many of his ordinances, and as much of his Lavv as poſſiblie vve could; that wee I ſay, ſhould reiect, any of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and deſire and indeauour to reiect and aboliſh as much of Gods Lavv, as poſsiblie by any wite we can deuiſe, this is monſtrouſly horrible, and much to be lamented.</p>
                     <p>This I dare conſidently auowch, that if our Miniſters pleaſed but to take parte with God, and vvould but ſpeake for Gods Sabbaths, what vvith a very little ſtudy, they are inabled to ſpeake, both by partes of nature, and Arte, that all the world could neuer be able to vvithſtand them; they would victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly beare downe all oppofition: and is it not to be lamented,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:21140:96"/>when Miniſters vvill not doe for God, vvhat they can, or may doe? but in ſtead of their little ſtudie in defence of this cauſe, all their care and ſtudy is hovv they may be ſtill ignorant of the point, leſt by knowledge of it they ſhould ſpeake for it, and ſo indanger their liuings &amp; reputations and the like: for generally they doe eſchew the reading of my booke, wherby they might be inſtructed in the point, without their labour, vnleſſe it be ſome fewe, vvho read it only to ſpie a mote in myne eye, and that they may picke out ſomthing to ſay againſt it: yea, they eſchevv alſo all arguing conferences, among them ſelues in priuate, wherby the point may be ſcanned and come to light: they permit not any of their brethren, to take vp a defence of the Lords Sabbaths, &amp; to argue againſt the Lords day, albeit he doth it but for argument ſake, the better to boult out the trueth; if any in the company will be more ingenuouſe and true harted then the reſt, as deſirouſe by oppoſeing of our tenets to find out the trueth, the ſhall be ſnibed &amp; curbed; ſome man of eminency in the place will put all to ſilence with ſuch words as theſe, no more of this point now, no more of this argument in this place; thus they are afraid leaſt God ſhould by theire conferences inlighten them: theſe things haue bene related to me by credible perſones: and are not theſe things to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? any man ſhall haue free liberty, heart and good will, to ſpeake in their company, any thing he can invent, againſt Gods Sabbaths, &amp; for the Lords day, but not on the contrary, to ſpeake for the Lords Sabbaths, &amp; againſt the Lords day: take my word for it, you ſhall neuer heare 2. Miniſters ſcann this point <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> before any of the people, as you ſhall heare them in ſome other pointes of doubt: nay it were to be wiſhed, that any 2. Miniſters vvould by themſelues when none heare, them, argue the point ſeriouſly <hi>pro</hi> &amp; <hi>con,</hi> the one taking the one parte, the other its contrary, that ſo Gods trueth may be found out; but I feare me, a man ſhall as ſoone dravv a Beare to the ſtake, to be baited with dogges, as dravv them to any ſuch courſe as may bring the point to light; they cannot but foreſee, the iſſue of this courſe vvould be, what they would ſhould not be: &amp; is not this to be lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, if I ſhould not preuaile with them
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21140:96"/>in ſo reaſonable a requeſt as this is? I deſire my brethren of the Miniſtri, to take into deepeſt conſideration Gods Sabbaths, to ſtudy the point ſeriouſly, to caſt a ſide preiudice; &amp; out of a loue to this ordinance of Gods, ſtudy but vvhat may be found in its defence, to ſtudy but with a like good will to defend this point, as they doe other pointes: and is not this to be lamented if I ſhal not preuaile?</p>
                     <p>When Paul was to take his laſt farvvell of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he could ſay with a good conſcience, that he was pure from the blood af all men, becauſe he had <hi>kept nothing backe, but had ſhewed them all the counſaile of God,</hi> Act. 20.26.27. But how many of our Miniſters, when they lye a dying, ſhall be able thus comfortablie to pleade for themſelues I know not: can they ſay they haue kept nothing backe of Gods counſaile, what not his Sabbaths? can they ſay to their flocke, they haue ſhewed them, all the Counſaile of God; what all the Lavv, in its integrity and perfection? what euery <hi>Iote</hi> &amp; <hi>Title</hi> of the Law? haue they baul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nothing for feare &amp; carnall reſpectes? or for vvant of that induſtry that might &amp; ought to haue bene in them, in ſerching out euery iot &amp; title of Gods Lavv in its perfection? for this let them knovv, that they muſt be countable to God, not onely for baulking &amp; concealing vvhat they knovv; but alſo for not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring vnto the people, vvhat by their ſtudy, they might and ought to haue knowne; if therefore they haue not bene ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; ſtudiouſe in the ſerching out of this parte of Gods Lavv, as they might and ought to haue bene, they may acquite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before men, but before God they ſhall neuer acquit them ſelues, eſpecially, if they haue refuſed a light into Gods Lavv, vvhen it hath bene tendered vnto them: and is not this to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, vvhen Miniſters vvill dye vvith feſtered &amp; guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences?</p>
                     <p>Many feare that Popery may inuade vs againe, and that were dangerouſe; but ſure I am Sabbath breaking doth raigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, and that is more dangerouſe: I meane it is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſe to continue among vs, then the other to inuade vs: for euery man is aſhamed to ſay ought in defence of Popery; but on the other ſide, euery man is imboldened to ſpeake in defence of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:21140:97"/>Sabbath breaking, and no man is aſhamed to ſpeake againſt the Lords Sabbaths, no not the Lords Miniſters; wherefore this ſinne, is a dangerouſe ſinne, men may commit it vvith authority of their Miniſters; men may commit it vvithout bluſhing, no man may check &amp; controule them by the 4th com. for their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters vvill defend them in it: and is not this to be lamented, vvhen men ſhall be boulſtered out &amp; defended in ſinne, &amp; that by Authority of the Miniſtry? vvhen I maruaile then, vvill this ſinne be reformed? As it vvas in thoſe vnlavvfull marriages, the text ſaith, <hi>And the hand of the Princes and rulers, hath bene chiefe in this treſpaſſe,</hi> Ezra. 9.2. So may I truely ſay, in this Sabbath breaking, the hand of the Miniſters &amp; Teachers, hath bene chiefe in this treſpaſſe: by ſo much the more therfore to be lamented.</p>
                     <p>But ſome man may ſay vnto me, vvhat ſhall it proffit a man to lament theſe corruptions of our time? he ſhall amende no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therby; for men are ſetled in their courſes; &amp; thers no ſtirring of them &amp;c. Well, be it ſo, if needs it muſt be ſo; yet this knovv, that if by thy teares, thou caneſt not amend others, yet hereby is not thy labour loſt to thy ſelfe, vnleſſe thou thikeſt that the Prophet Davids teares were in vanie, when he ſaid, <hi>Mine eyes guſh out with riuers of waters, becauſe they keepe not thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.136. God hath a bottle for ſuch teares; for here by thou bewraieſt thy loue to God: and thy loue to Gods Law; &amp; thy loue to the welfare of the ſoules of thy brethren: and further, as God diliuered <hi>iuſt Lot</hi> vexed with the ſines of thoſe times, 2.

                     <p>For concluſion; let vs make our daily prayers, vnto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, that he would <hi>bring into the way of trueth, all ſuch as haue erred, and are deceiued:</hi> and againe to confirme this

                     <p>FIrſt of all, a word or tvvo touching the name <hi>Lords day:</hi> It is to be obſerued, that this name Lords day, the which we now put vpon our Sunday, or firſt day of the weeke; yea vpon euery S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nday, and vpon euery firſt day of the vveeke, it is not found to be ſo vſed in the Scriptures: that is, it is not found in the Scriptures, that euery Sunday in a yeere was called Lords day: For all the iiij Euangeliſts, <hi>Mathew, Marke, Luke,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> yea &amp; S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, they neuer called our Sunday, or firſt day of the vveeke, Lords day; for, they euer called it, the firſt day of the vveeke, by it old name, ſee Mat. 28.1. Mark. 16.2.9. Luk. 24.1. Ioh. 20.1.19. Actor. 20.7. 1. Cor. 16.2. Onely once it is found perhaps, to be called Lords day, but it was long firſt, as by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Reuel. 1.10. ſo the oddes is 8 to one; for our Sunday, is found to be called 8 times, the firſt day of the vveeke, for once called Lords day.</p>
                     <p>The knovvledge of this point may be vſefull vnto vs theſe vvayes; firſt, is it ſo, that our Sunday had no nevv name put vpon it by none of the <hi>Euangeliſts,</hi> but that it vvas freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly called the firſt day of the vveeke ſtill, by its old name, &amp; that after Chriſt his reſurrection; Then is it a matter very likly &amp; probable, that this day had no new inſtitution or ordination, but that it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after Chriſt his reſurrection, as it vvas before his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in its old nature ſtill, that is, to be a vvorking day ſtill, as it was before: For it is very likely, that if the old nature and vſe of the day had bene changed, that the old name alſo would haue bene changed, and a nevv name put vpon it. If this name Lords day, had betokened any change of the vſe of this day, from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vſe vnto an holy vſe, in memory of Chriſt his reſurrection, me thinke ſome of the 4 Euangeliſts vvould haue ſaid ſome ſuch like thing; and ſome of them vvould in token thereof, haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the name of the day, and called it Lords day: but for ſo much as the Euangeliſts (who doe largly, &amp; euery one of them, ſet forth the Lords reſurrection) haue neuerthemore, either ſpake any thing, any of them touching the change of the day, in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:21140:98"/>memory of the reſurrection; no nor ſo much as giuen it the nevv name Lords day; but conſtantly all of them agreeing, in retaining its old name ſtill; it is a thing very likly, that they knew nothing of the alteration or change of the day at all: It is moſt probable therefore, that our Sunday or Lords day, was a working day, in the dayes of the 4 Euangeliſts, after Chriſt his Reſurrection, and at that time, when they wrote their Goſpels.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly, but ſuppoſe we for argument ſake, that this name Lords day, had ſome ſecret virtue in it (as the patrones of it would make vs beleeue) to betoken, that the day ſo named, muſt needs be a Sabbath day; yet it followeth not, that euery of our Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, and euery firſt day of the weeke, muſt be kept for a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; for, it is not found in the Apoſtles times, that they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led euery Sunday, Lords day, as we doe; for they, the moſt of them, neuer named our Sunday, Lords day, but ſtill called it, by its old name, <hi>the firſt day of the weeke;</hi> yea, 8 times it was called by its old name, the firſt day of the weeke, to once the <hi>Lords day:</hi> Wherefore, it is likly, that this Sunday was kept for a Sabbath, not conſtantly, but ſeldome, as namely, vpon ſome one firſt day of the vveeke or other, once in a quarter or halfe a yeere, or once in a yeere, or the like: ſo often as it can be proued, that our Sunday, was called Lords day; ſo often it poſſibly may be, that our Sunday muſt be kept for a Sabbath, &amp; not ofter: now I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it will trouble the patrons of this weekly Lords day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, to proue, that euer there was any more Sundayes called Lords day, then one in a yeere onely: ſo then, the moſt that can be made of this name Lords day, is to vrge the people to keepe it for a Sabbath day, once in a yeere onely. What iniury then is done to the people, to cauſe them to refraine the workes of their calling, on euery Sunday throughout the yeere; and that vnder this pretenſe that euery Sunday in the yeere is the Lords day, &amp; ſo a Sabbath day? let this be thought on.</p>
                     <p>Secondly as touching the name of the day; It is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that our Sunday is no where in all the New Teſtament named Sabbath day: but it is euer called, either the firſt day of the weeke, or the Lords day: Yea, S. Mathew, doth plainly diſtinguiſh betwixt the Sabbath day, and the firſt day of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21140:99"/>weeke; as being the one the day before the other; the one vpon the Saturday, the other vpon the Sunday. <hi>Now in the end of of the Sabbath, when the firſt day of the weeke begane to dawne,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 28.1. the ſame doth S. Mark alſo; <hi>And when the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day was paſt, &amp;c.</hi> they bought ſweete oyntments, &amp;c. and <hi>erly in the morning, the firſt day of the weeke, they came to the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, &amp;c.</hi> Mark. 16.12. the ſame is plaine alſo, by <hi>S.</hi> Luke, Luk. 23.56. Luk. 24.1. and by S. Iohn, Ioh. 19.31. Ioh. 20.1. ſo then the Sabbath day, was the day before our Sunday, or firſt day of the weeke.</p>
                     <p>The knowledge of this point, bewraieth the errour of our Miniſters, in calling our Lords day, and firſt day of the weeke; <hi>Sabbath day:</hi> this their practiſe is all together growndleſſe: for none of the Apoſtles euer called the Lord day Sabbath day: no, they did as you ſee proued, diſtinguiſh betweene the Lords day, and the Sabbath day, as being the one, the day after the other.</p>
                     <p>Nay they are much departed from the practiſe of the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts; for they called our <hi>Saturday,</hi> the day before our Lords day, Sabbath day; but many of our Miniſters, who vvill be thought to follovv the Apoſtles in keeping the Lords day for a Sabbath, yet will not follow them in calling our Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, Sabbath day: if they will imitate the Apoſtles, and Apoſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall times in one thing, why ſhould they not imitate them in an other? if the practiſe of the Apoſtles doth binde vs, as they teach; then vvhy doe they not cale our <hi>Saturday,</hi> Sabbath day, ſince that vvas the practiſe of the Apoſtles? why is not Saturday honoured vvith that proper name which doth belong vnto it? why doe they deceiptfully robb the Saturday, of its honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble name Sabbath day, and put it vpon the Lords day? the very Papiſts ſhew more fidelity in this point, then we Proteſtants; for they imitate the Apoſtolike times, and to this day, they call Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, <hi>dies Sabbathi,</hi> and, <hi>Sabbathum,</hi> that is, Sabbath day, as did the Apoſtles: wherefore, if we vvill doe as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, vve muſt call Saturday, Sabbath day, and if vve vvill not be worſe then <hi>Papiſts,</hi> vve muſt call our Saturday, Sabbath day ſtill.</p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:21140:99"/>
                     <p> Sometimes vve vvill borrow light, from the primitiue Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; vvhy reade the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, for 300. yeers &amp; more after Chriſt; and you ſhall find them calling our Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the day before our Lords day, Sabbath day, conſtantly: how cometh it about then, that our times are ſo farr denegera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the primitiue churches, that vve abhorre to call the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, Sabbath day? and inſtead thereof, the Lords day muſt be called Sabbath day: this nevv Chriſtening or new naminge of dayes, is a nouill thing, it is a nouelty of late inuention.</p>

The knowledge of this point, may proue proffitable to common people, for their direction, in reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both of the Old &amp; New Teſtament; for often times they ſhall in reading meet with this name Sabbath day: Now they muſt be carefull which day of the weeke to apply it vnto, elſe a foule errour is committed, albeit hitherto men haue not thought ſo: by the name Sabbath day is meant our Saturday, as you ſee it proued by all the 4 Euangeliſts aboue mentioned; and as is plaine by the practiſe of the primitiue Church for 300 yeers and more after Chriſt: vvherefore when you meete vvith the name Sabbath day, as in Iſai. 58.13. Nehem. 13.18. Act. 13.14.42.44. Act. 16.13. Act. 17.2. and Act. 18.4. You muſt vnderſtand it of Saturday; and not of Sunday, or the Lords day, vvhich wee novv call, and miſcall Sabbath day: it is ſtrange to ſee how ignorant people are in this point; for they make no difference betwixt Sabbath day, and Lords day, but take them for the ſame, when as Sabbath day, is on the 7th day, and Lords day, is on the 8th day: hence is their errour, that when they reade any of thoſe forementioned Scriptures, they apply them to the Lords day; as if in <hi>Eſaias,</hi> and in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> times, the Lords day, had bene then in vſe for a Sabbath; vvhat a monſtrouſe errour is this? againe, when they reade the 4th com. Exod. 20.8. which ſpeaketh of the Sabbath day, they here againe ignorantly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by Sabbath day, the Lords day; and yet that was on the 7th day of the vveeke, and this is on the 8th day of the vveeke; as if the Lords day, had bene in vſe for a Sabbath day, in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, and at the giuing of the lavv: but let this already ſaid, be enough to reforme this errour for time to come; you ſee all the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:21140:100"/>4 Euangeliſts after Chriſts reſurrection, calling the day before our Sunday or firſt day of the vveeke, vvhich is Saturday, the Sabbath day; vvherefore if here after, your Miniſters vvill miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply the 4th com. to the Lords day, beleeue them not: for you ſee all the 4 Euangeliſts call Saturday, the Sabbath day; not Lords day, the Sabbath day; and the 4th com. is for that day on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is named Sabbath day, as you may ſee by reading it. The rather this is to be noted, becauſe ſuch a miſtake of one day for an other, in a <hi>bond,</hi> may forfeit your bond; as in caſe through a miſtake, you carry your money in the 8th day of the moneth, when it is due on the 7th day of the moneth: now the 4th com. is a <hi>bond,</hi> wherein man ſtands bound vnto God, to pay his diuine ſeruice, on the 7th day of the weeke, but if he delaies vntill the 8th day, I dare aſſure him that he hath forfeited vvith God, and broken the bond of the 4th comm: For this bond is not due and payable on the 8th but on the 7th day. Looke to it, as you vvill. Thus much for the name, now we come to the thing and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it ſelfe.</p>

                     <p>For the better ſcaning of this point, whither the Lords day, be a Sabbath day or not, by Gods ordinance, I purpoſe to handle 2 maine queſtions: the one is whither euery firſt day of the weeke, euery Sunday, &amp; euery Lords day, be a Sabbath day or not: (and here, &amp; hereafter, I purpoſe to let it goe for granted them for argument ſake, that euery Sunday is &amp; may be called Lords day, vvhich yet can neuer as you haue ſeene be proued by the Scriptures:) the other is, whither any one Sunday, firſt day of the vveeke, or Lords day, be a Sabbath day or not. Touching which queſtions, let it be obſerued, and I dare ſay it, that Papiſts can ſay as much out of the Scriptures, in defence of that Fable, of the Fyer in Purgatory; as can be ſaid in defence of the Lords day, to be a Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p>Touching the former queſtion, that euery Lords day muſt be a Sabbath day conſtantly; if they cannot proue this conſtancy, that euery Sunday muſt be a Sabbath day; then it vvill follovv, that we are not now tied to keepe a Sabbath once euery weeke, but onely ſometimes; as once in a quarter of a yeere, or halfe a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:21140:100"/>yeere, or once in a yeere, or the like, and ſo the life and ſoule of this nevv Sabbath, is extinguiſhed and as good as vaniſhed. That it may appeare, vvhat they can make good this vvay, I vvill produce you all their textes of Scripture, out of vvhich they muſt proue this point if it can be proued; and if it ſhall appeare, that none of thoſe Scriptures vvill afforde any ground, for a conſtant vveekly Sabbath, then you vvill ſay with me, that they goe groundleſly to vvorke, when they vrge a conſtant kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Lords day.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of their Textes is the 4th Com. Exod, 20.8. But to this Text I anſwer, that it is true in deed, that the 4th Comm. doth call for a weekly Sabbath, but this Text hath nothing at all to doe with the Lords day, as ſhall be ſhowne fully in the next queſtion: wherefore this Text is not to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Text they haue &amp; it is, Reuel. 1.10. <hi>I was in the Spririt on the Lords day:</hi> to this Text I anſwer, admit for argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſake, that this Lords day, whereon S. Iohn receiued his Reuelation, vvere a Sabbath day, and that this name Lords day, did impley ſo much; yet can it not be proued from hence that euery Sunday, and euery firſt day of the weeke, was a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day: all that can be gathered out of this Text, is but to proue one day a Sabbath day, and namely that one day, which vvas called Lords day, in this Text: (if it could be certainly found out which day of the weeke it was.) As hath bene ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, it cannot be proued, that euery firſt day of the the weeke, is in Scripture called Lords day: vvherefore, it cannot be proued, that any more firſt dayes of the weeke, are Sabbaths, then are called in Scripture, Lords day, and that is but one day in a yee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re onely, or the like. Further, it will not follow neither from the name or nature of the Sabbath day, that if the Lords day, be a Sabbath day, then it muſt be a weekly Sabbath day, as in the 4th Com. for there vvere weekely Sabbaths, and yeerly Sabbaths alſo, in the Lavv; novv ſince they hold the vveekly Sabbaths ceremonies, a ſvvell as the yeerly Sabbaths, how kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p> A third Text they haue, &amp; that is, Pſ. 118.24. <hi>This is the day, which the Lord hath made; let vs reioyce and be glad in it:</hi> To this Text I anſvver, as before, admit for argument ſake, that this day muſt be a Sabbath day; yet as vve ſay, one ſvvallovv mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not a Sommer, ſo one Sabbath day, maketh not a conſtant practiſe: this Text can make vvay for no more Sabbaths, then one in a yeere, or one in a mans life time; for Dauid, had but one day in his life time, in vvhich he vvas Crovvned King; nor had Chriſt here typed by Dauid, any more dayes for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, then one: ſo ſtill here is nothing for the conſtancy of a vveekly Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p>A fourth text they haue, and that is, Act. 2. vvhere, vpon the day of <hi>Pentecoſt, Peter</hi> preached, and conuerted 3000 ſoules, &amp;c.

                     <p>A fift Text they haue, &amp; it is, Act. 20.7. vvhere Paul prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at <hi>Troas</hi> vntill midnight, &amp;c. vnto vvhich text I anſvver as before, be it this day, vvere a Sabbath day, becauſe Paul preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſermon then, vvhich can neuer be therby proued to be a Sabbath day; yet vvhat is this to a conſtancy? this vvas a rare &amp; ſeldome action, once onely done; novv Pauls ſeldome &amp; rare preaching cannot bind vs to an often &amp; frequent preaching,

Can it be ſhowne, that euer Paul did any where, or at any time, preach twiſe together, vpon two Lords dayes, one after an other?

                     <p>A ſixth Text they haue, and it is, 1 Cor. 16.2. <hi>vpon the firſt day of the weeke, let euery one lay by him, in ſtore,</hi> &amp;c. Here it is thought, that there vvas a Collection for the poore, and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, &amp; ſo it vvas a Sabbath day. Vnto this Text I anſwer as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let it be granted, which neuer can be proued, that this was a Sabbath day, becauſe there was a collection for the poore; yet this Text proueth not, any continued conſtancy, of Sunday after Sunday, euery Sunday, or euery firſt day of the weeke; for, it ſpeaketh but of one ſingle action, once done onely, ſaying, <hi>vpon the firſt day, of the weeke:</hi> not euery firſt day of the vveeke.</p>
                     <p>But touching this my anſwer, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                     <p> Secondly I anſvver, that foraſmuch as our Nevv <hi>Tranſlatours,</hi> haue altered &amp; amended our old Tranſlation, I maruaile that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                     <p>The 7th &amp; laſt thing they haue, that hath any likelihood to proue this conſtancy, is the frequent Apparitions of Chriſt euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more vpon the firſt day of the vveeke, or Lords day: To this I anſwer as before, ſuppoſe we that Chriſt his Apparition vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <p>I confeſſe there is a text alleaged, for a ſecond Lords day, wherein he appeared, &amp; it is Ioh. 20.26. <hi>And eight dayes after, againe his Diſciples were within, and Thomas with them &amp;c.</hi> To this text I anſwer 1. Suppoſe this text could proue a ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition, vpon a ſecond Lords day, yet this is not a conſtant practiſe of Chriſt, euery Lords day. 2. But this text is nothing to their purpoſe: for they ſuppoſe, that this phraſe <hi>eight dayes after,</hi> compared with Ioh. 20.19. where is mention of the firſt day of the weeke, doth note vnto vs Chriſts ſecond dayes appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, to be on the ſame day ſennight, after that firſt day of the weeke, whereon Chriſt roſe, Ioh. 26.1.19. and ſo conſequently vpon the Lords day alſo: But let the words of the text be better conſidered of, and they will afforde no ſuch collection: for the Text ſaith not, vpon the ſame day ſennight wherein Chriſt roſe &amp;c. but it ſaith, <hi>eight dayes after,</hi> the day wherin he roſe &amp;c. Now 8 dayes after Sunday, cannot fall vpon the Sunday againe, the ſame day ſennight; but on the Monday ſennight after: for the word <hi>after</hi> doth exclude the firſt Sunday, vvhereon Chriſt roſe, that it muſt not be counted for any one of theſe 8 dayes; for then he ſhould haue ſaid, <hi>vpon the 8th day</hi> &amp;c. but he ſaith, after 8 dayes &amp;c. The nevv Tranſlation readeth it thus <hi>and after eight dayes</hi> &amp;c. Now, after 8 dayes, muſt be on the 9th day, or 10th day &amp;c. and ſo not on the ſame day ſennight as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
                     <p>It is true, they bring a text, wherein is a like phraſe, as Mark. 8.31. <hi>And after 3 dayes riſe againe</hi> &amp;c. which muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſay they, thus, and vpon the third day riſe againe &amp;c. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:21140:103"/>to 1. Cor. 15.4. which ſaith, <hi>he roſe the third day</hi> &amp;c. But I anſwer, howbeit I could giue other anſwers, yet this ſhall ſuffice for this, that, be it in a caſe of neceſſity, to reconcile two textes of Scripture, we be neceſſitated to departe from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe of the one; yet vvhere is no neceſſity, as here is none, there to departe from the proper ſenſe of vvords, is vnſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by the iudgement of all Interpreters: what other text is there, which ſaith, <hi>Vpon the eight day, againe his Diſciples were within</hi> &amp;c? Or what abſurdety is in it, to take the vvords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, as that Chriſt appeared 8 dayes after the day of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, vpon the Monday? ſo then, notwithſtanding all their wreſting, this text can make nothing for Chriſts apparition, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſecond Lords day: where then are thoſe apparitions of Chriſt, ſo conſtantly vpon euery Lords day? there can but one dayes apparition be ſhowne; and ſo conſequently, there can be proued but one Sabbath day, as namely once in a yeere, vpon <hi>Easter</hi> day; for Chriſts apparition was vpon Eaſter day, being the day he roſe on: hitherto then, they cannot proue a weekly Sabbath, vpon euery Lords day.</p>
                     <p>For all this I deny not, but that it may be proued, that Chriſt appeared vpon euery Lords day, after his reſurrection; becauſe he appeared on euery day, for 40 daies together, Act. 1.3. But this text, I know they dare not bring againſt me, leaſt whilſt they proue the frequent apparitions of Chriſt vpon euery Lords day, they diſproue their nevv Sabbath day, and quite ouerturne it: for, if Chriſt made his apparitions, vpon euery day of the vveeke, for 40 daies together; then is euery day of the vveeke aſmuch a Sabbath, as is the Lords day: becauſe Chriſt appeared, aſvvell vpon euery day, as vpon the Lords day; yea, he appared the third time, vpon a <hi>Fiſhing</hi> day, vvhen they vvent a fiſhing Ioh. 21.1.3.6. which they made a vvorking day, for all Chriſts apparition to them on that day. Loe, vvhat poore ſtuffe here is, to proue the conſtant practiſe of the Lords day, &amp; yet I haue heard ſome graue <hi>Diuins</hi> affirme, that this one argument, of Chriſts conſtant appearing on the Lords day, doth abundantly ſatisfie them, for proofe of the Lords day Sabbath. Doe you not thinke therefore, that it is poore ſtuffe, that will ſatisfy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:21140:104"/>of ſome Miniſters? had not people need in theſe dayes to <hi>trye all things, and keepe that which is good?</hi> 1. Theſſ. 5.21.</p>
                     <p>Thus I haue anſwered all their textes; and yet no conſtant continued practiſe of the Lords day, appeareth: But happily they may thinke, that albeit none of theſe textes &amp; examples, will ſinglie &amp; alone proue the conſtancy, yet if all be put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may proue it: well, we will doe them no wrong, let vs ioyne them all together then: we will begin at the day of Chriſt his <hi>reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> for this is the firſt ſuppoſed new Sabbath day, Ioh. 20.1.19. and vpon this day, Chriſt appeared to his Diſciples: but we reade not of any other Lords day, after that, wherein was any Sabbath day dueties done, vntill <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> Act. 2.1. &amp;c. which was about 50 daies, after the reſurrection day: ſo then here was no continued practiſe; for we reade not of any thing done here for ſixe weekes, or ſixe Lords daies together.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The next day ſuppoſed for a Sabbath day, is that firſt day of the vveeke, wherein Paul preached till midnight at <hi>Troas,</hi> Act. 20.7. Now we are to ſerch how long this ſermon of Paul at Troas, was preached after the ſermon of Peter, at Ieruſalem, on Pentecoſt day, whither Pauls ſermon were the next Lords day, after Pentecoſt day, or not: For this end, we muſt note, that Paul was no preacher at Chriſts death, nor at Pentecoſt neither, which vvas 7 vveekes after Chriſts death: for Paul made ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke of the Church, Act. 7.58. Act. 9.1. long after Pentecoſt day; and it is holden, that Paul was not conuerted, till the 3d yeere after Chriſts aſcention: now after his conuerſion, it was at leaſt 14 yeeres before he went to Ieruſalem, Gal. 1.18. Gal. 2.1. now in this his latter iourney to Ieruſalem, Gal. 2.1. I ſuppoſe it was, when he vvent vp about the difference of Circumciſion, Act. 15.2. which being determined, he returned, and in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne he deliuered the Decrees of the Apoſtles, to ſeuerall Churches where he came, Act. 16.4. and ſo as he went along he preached, as at <hi>Philippi,</hi> Act. 16.12.13. and at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> Act. 17.1.2. and at <hi>Corinth,</hi> Act. 18.1.4. and at laſt he came to <hi>Troas</hi> where he preached this ſermon, of which we doe inquire Act. 20.7. So then, count theſe, &amp; it will be found about a matter of 17. yeeres difference, betvvixt the ſermon of Peter at Pentecoſt,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21140:104"/>and the ſermon of Paul at Troas: vvhere then is the conſtancy of the Lords day Sabbath, vvhen vve can finde none kept for a matter of 17. yeeres together?</p>
                     <p>The 3d text wherein is mention of our new Sabbath, it is 1. Cor. 16.2. vvhere Paul ordeined a collection, to be made on the firſt day of the vveeke &amp;c. Novv how many weekes, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, or yeeres, this collection was ordeined, after Pauls ſermon at Troas, Act. 20.7. I cannot tell; nor can they proue, that it was the next Lords day after the ſermon Paul preached at Troas: ſo then, as yet there can no conſtant vveekly Sabbath be proued. The laſt text is Reu. 1.10. where S. Iohn receiued a reuelation on the Lords day; now how many yeeres difference there was, betvvixt the ordination for that Collection for the poore, 1. Cor. 16.2. and S. Iohns Reuelation, I know not; neither can they proue I preſume, that it was on the next Lords day after that Collection. So ſtill there appeareth no conſtant and weekly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Lords day; let their textes be conſidered this way, or that vvay.</p>
                     <p>Whereas they talke ſo much of the conſtant practiſe of the Apoſtles, this I dare auowch, that it cannot be ſhowne, that euer <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other of the Apoſtles of Chriſt, did euer preach any ſermons, vpon tvvo Lords dayes, immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing one an other: Nay vvhich is more, it cannot be ſhovvne, that any one Apoſtle, did euer preach tvviſe in all his life time, vpon the Lords day: nay, vvhich is yet more, it can not be ſhovvne, that all the Apoſtles, put them all together, did euer among them all, preach tvvo Lords dayes together, one after an other. Who that conſidereth theſe things, could be ſo blinded, as to thinke this Lords day, can be eſtabliſhed &amp; proued to be a weekly Sabbath from the Apoſtles practiſe? ſurely, he that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brateth a weekly Sabbath on the Lords day, as he hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement for it from Chriſt in the new Teſtament, ſo he hath not ſo much as the vveekly practiſe of the Apoſtles, for his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
                     <p>But my Brethren, if you vvill vvalke, in a vvarrantable vvay, vvherein you ſhall haue both an expreſſe commandement from God, and alſo the vveekly and conſtant practiſe of the Apoſtles,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21140:105"/>then forſake the Lords day, the Sunday Sabbath: and keepe the Sabbath day, the Saturday Sabbath: for, for it, you haue the 4th com. expreſly: and then for practiſe of the Apoſtles, be pleaſed but to pervſe theſe textes of Scripture, and you ſhall find the Apoſtles conſtantly, keeping the Sabbath day, ſee Act. 13.14, 42.44. Act. 16.13. Act. 17.2. &amp; Act. 18.4. and this was all after Chriſt his reſurrection: Now iudge thou that readeſt, whither the practiſe of the Lords day weekly, or the practiſe of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day weekly, be more ſoundly proued, and follow the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>Be no more children, wanering &amp; carried about with euery wind of doctrine, by the deceit of men, and with craftineſſe, whereby they lay in waite to deceiue,</hi> Eph. 4.14. But, <hi>try all things, and keepe that which is good,</hi> 1. Theſſ. 5.21.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, whereas it is ſuppoſed, that this Lords day was kept conſtantly for A Sabbath; I will giue inſtance to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: of all Lords dayes that euer were, that firſt Lords day, wherein Chriſt roſe from the dead, and then appeared vnto his Diſciples, that Lords day was the moſt eminent and chiefe; for from this day, all after Lords dayes take their name &amp; excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; this being the ſubſtance as it were, and all others but ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes &amp; reſſemblances of this: for on this firſt Lords day, was the worke of the Reſurrection performed, &amp; not on the others: of all Coronation dayes in the Kings reigne, none is ſo properly called Coronation day, nor ſo excellent &amp; ioyfull, as is the firſt Coronation day, in which the Crowne is ſet vpon the Kings head: Many keepe their Marriage dayes, but of them all, none is ſo excellent and ſo ſolemnly kept, as is the firſt Marriage day, wherein the Bride &amp; Bridgrome were ioyned together: euen ſo it is betweene the firſt Lords day, and other Lords dayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after it: The difference is, as the body from the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; and as the life from the picture; if therefore I ſhall ſhevv that this firſt Lords day, vvas not kept as a Sabbath day, it is more then if I ſhould ſhevv that 20 Lords dayes together, were omitted in the Apoſtles dayes, after Chriſts aſcention. Further, if I ſhall ſhevv, that Chriſt himſelfe, and his Diſciples, whilſt hee vvas on earth, and reſident vvith his Church, did not keepe this firſt &amp; moſt eminent Lords day; who then vvill imagine,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21140:105"/>that theſe Diſciples of Chriſt, and this Church, vvould keepe the Lords day a Sabbath, after Chriſts departure from them, &amp; aſcention into heauen? for vndoubtedly, the Church would imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chriſt, &amp; follovv his example; looke vvhat they ſaw him doe, whilſt he was on earth vvith them, the ſame vvould they doe, after he was departed from them: <hi>follow me (ſaith Paul) as I follow Chriſt,</hi> 1. Cor. 11.1.</p>
                     <p>Novv I ſhevve that this firſt Lords day, vvas not kept as a Sabbath and Reſting day: becauſe it vvas vſed for a <hi>trauailing</hi> day: for this purpoſe ſee, Luk. 24.1.13. vvhere you haue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of two of Chriſts Diſciples, vvho trauailed vpon this firſt Lords day, whereon Chriſt roſe, a matter of 15 myles: and this I make good thus, they went from Ieruſalem, for there the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were reſident, v. 9. and they trauailed to <hi>Emmaus</hi> which Towne vvas <hi>threeſcore</hi> furlongs, from Ieruſalem, as the Text ſaith, v. 13. novv 8. furlongs make a myle; ſo then 60. furlongs, make Seauen myles and an halfe: this done, they returned the ſame day, backe againe to Ieruſalem, v. 33. vvhich is ſeauen myles &amp; an halfe more; ſo add theſe together, &amp; they trauailed that day, fiftene myles: it cannot be thought that theſe ſpent leſſe time, then all the vvhole after noone of this firſt Lords day, in trauailing: for tvvo myles an hovvre, is an ordenary tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nailers paſe, ſo that fiftene myles coſt them neere 8. hovvres vvorke.</p>
                     <p>Novv can it be thought, that theſe two of Chriſts Diſciples, vvould haue made this day, of all dayes in the yeere, a trauail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, if the Church of Chriſt had ſolemnized this day as a Sabbath day, at Ieruſalem? theſe two, vvere two of Chriſts Diſciples &amp; follovvers, vvherefore they vvould haue laid a ſide all vvorkes, that they might vvith ioyfulneſſe haue ſolemnized this day, in a moſt thankfull remembrance of Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if any fame or report they had heard at Ieruſalem, before they came forth, that this day ſhould haue bene celebrated for a Sabbath, in memory of the Reſurrection of their Lord and Maſter: Chriſts Diſciples vvere ſad, and ſorrovvfull men novv, for the death &amp; loſſe of their Lord &amp; Maſter, Mark. 16.10. Luk. 24.17. hovv therfore vvould they haue ſhevved all tokens of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21140:106"/>ioy &amp; thankfulneſſe, for his reſtoring to life againe, by celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Sabbath, if they had knovvne of any? Beſids, theſe tvvo vvere religiouſe &amp; deuout men, or elſe they vvere hypocrites novv vvhitherſoeuer they vvere, had they but heard any rumor at Jeruſalem, that morning before they came forth, that this day preſent, ſhould be ſolemnized by the Church of Chriſt, for the firſt Chriſtian Sabbath of all ſucceeding generations; &amp; that they ſhould leade the vvay, and ſet a patterne to all follovving generations, doubtleſſe they vvould for this day, haue laide aſide all iourneys: Further, the Church of Chriſts Diſciples, vvere not ſo many then, but that tvvo men might be miſſed, if abſent from the Chamber vvhere they mett; novv if they vvere truely religiouſe, then vvould they not haue bene abſent from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Saints, ſo in loue they vvere vvith ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, if they had knovvne of any: if they vvere hypocrites, they vvould not haue bene abſent at ſuch a time, for their credit ſake, leaſt they ſhould be pointed at for it: all vvhich, laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, declare plainly, that they knevv not of any Sabbath to be kept that day; nor that it vvas knovvne to the reſidue of the Diſciples at Ieruſalem; for then they ſhould haue heard of it from them, by a common reporte, like as they heard before they came forth, of all other things, that had happened on that day, ſee v. 22.23.24. So much for the trauailing of the tvvo Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, on the Lords day.</p>
                     <p>But happily the Patrones of our nevv Sabbath, vvill plead, that this trauaile might be ſome vvorke of neceſſity &amp; charity, &amp; ſo a Sabbath dayes vvorke. To vvhom I anſvver, that ſure I am the text giueth no ſuch light: a Sabbath dayes iourney in common eſtimation is but tvvo myles, Act. 1.12. but this is much more then a Sabbath dayes iourney, for it vvas 15 myles: but ſuppoſe they could proue, that this trauaile, vvas ſome vvorke of neceſſity &amp;c. yet vve knovv that as they vvent to Emmaus, ſo they returned backe againe that night: novv be it that there was neceſſity for their goeing forth to Emmaus that day; yet, vvhat likelihood vvas there, of any neceſſity, for them to come backe againe ſeauen myles &amp; an halfe to Jeruſalem, on the ſame day? might they not haue tarried at Emmaus, till the next day?</p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:21140:106"/>
                     <p> I come novv to ſhevv, hovv Chriſt himſelfe made this firſt Lords day, a trauailing day: for firſt of all after he roſe, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto Mary Magdalene Mark. 16.9. Secondly, he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto tvvo Diſciples as they trauailed to Emmaus Mark. 16.12. and here, he trauailed from Ieruſalem, vnto Emmaus, vvith the tvvo Diſciples, Luk. 24.13.15.28.29.30. and this was ſeauen myles &amp; an halfe, as hath bene counted: Furthermore, that he might ſhevv himſelfe, vnto the reſidue of the Diſciples, the ſame day, he trauailed backe againe to Ieruſalem, Luk. 24.33.36. Mark. 16.14. Ioh. 20.19. and this his iourney vvas ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen myles and an halfe more; ſo here you ſee our Sauiour Chriſt made this day a trauailing day alſo, by iournying from place to place, 7 or 8 myles at a time: Novv vvho could thinke this Lords day, to be kept by Chriſt for a Sabbath day, when he made it his trauailing day?</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, let it be obſerued that a Sabbath vvas by the lavv to be kept in &amp; with <hi>holy Congregations &amp; Aſſemblies,</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. 23.2.3. &amp; accordingly it was Chriſt his manner, euermore on the Sabbath dayes, to be in the Congregation among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, as we reade Luk. 4.16. <hi>And he came to Nazareth, and, as his custome was, went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, &amp; ſtood up to read &amp;c.</hi> So then, it was a cuſtomary thing with Chriſt, on the Sabbath dayes, to be teaching in the Aſſemblies: but loe, on this Lords day, hee was in the fields, trauailing too &amp; fro: &amp; ſomtimes he was in the company of two of his Diſciples, and ſomtime all alone, Luk. 24.31. and he came not into the aſſemblie of his Diſciples, vntill neere night, Ioh. 20.19. Novv Chriſt being the Shepheard &amp; Miniſter, where ſhould he haue bene, but in the aſſemblie of his Diſciples all that day, teaching them, &amp; preaching vnto them, if it had bene a Sabbath day? but loe, the flocke was ſcattered, ſome of the Diſciples were at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; other ſome were trauailing to Emmaus; and Chriſt the <hi>Paſtour</hi> of the flocke, he came not amongſt them vntill the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but was in the fields trauailing hither and thither: was this Lords day, kept like a Sabbath, by this Chriſtian Church? iudge thou that readeſt.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid, that Chriſt did inſtruct thoſe two Diſciples, in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21140:107"/>trauailing to Emmaus, and therefore it was a Sabbath duety: I anſwer, what did Chriſt doe more here, then <hi>Phillip</hi> did to the <hi>Eunuch</hi> in a trauailing day? the Eunuch riding in his charrer, did not Phillip inſtruct him? ſee Act. 8.27.28.35. and muſt this day be therefore a Sabbath day? yea, what did Chriſt more heere to theſe two Diſciples, then he did on euery day of the weeke, for 40 dayes together, to all the Apoſtles together, ſee Act. 1.3. and muſt all theſe 40 dayes therefore be Sabbaths? and theſe inſtructions, Sabbath dueties? there is no more likelihood, that theſe ſhould be Sabbath dueties, then there is to ſuppoſe it a Sabbath duety, to ſee a man ſit ſtill, and reſt him for an hovvre or tvvo on a working day; eſpeciaſly if during that time he doth but read a Chapter in the Bible, or the like. Furthermore, can it be thought, that Chriſt who vvas the Paſtor of the flocke, would ſpend his Sabbath day, in teaching tvvo of the ſheepe of the flocke onely, neglecting the reſidue? for, he came not among the vvhole flock aſſembled together, vntill neere night, Ioh. 20.19. Luk. 24.29.33. Wherefore, Chriſt kept not this Lords day, a Sabbath, vvith the aſſemblie, and congregation of his Diſciples, and can it then be thought, he kept it vvith tvvo men onely?</p>
                     <p>Loe, this is the Lords day, vvhich our nevv Sabbatharians, vvould haue for a Sabbath; and you ſee Chriſt the Lord of it, trauailed too &amp; fro, hither &amp; thither vpon it; you ſee alſo hovv the Diſciples of Chriſt, trauailed out &amp; home 15 myles vpon it; yea, and Chriſt, the Lord of this nevv Sabbath, looking on them, vvithout checke; nay vvhich is more, countenancing of them therein; for he iuſtified them, by his ovvne like practiſe, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing along vvith them, Luk. 24.15.</p>
                     <p>I vvould aske a queſtion here, of our nevv Sabbatharians, vvhich is this; May not we Chriſtians, ſafely trauaile vpon the Lords day, fitene, or twenty myles, more or leſſe, about the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denary affaires of our callings, without ſcruple of conſcience? Paul ſaith that we ſhould follow him, as he followed Chriſt, 1. Cor. 11.1. Now ſuer I am, the Diſciples of Chriſt, trauailed vpon the Lords day, and if therein they followed not Chriſt, yet they vvent together vvith him, vvhich is as good; for both Chriſt, and they, trauailed on the Lords day to Emmaus: why
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:21140:107"/>then may not we trauaile on the Lords day alſo? may we not imitate our Sauiour Chriſt? and muſt vve make more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Lords day, then Chriſts owne Diſciples did, who were taught by Chriſt himſelfe? what needleſſe, and nice ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is our times falne into? our Church makes conſcience, where the Church of Chriſt, who inioyed Chriſts corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, made none.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, that we may breake the backe of this nevv Sabbaths conſtancy; I will proue vnto you, that this firſt, and moſt famouſe Lords day, that euer was, was not kept for a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, by the Church of Chriſt then liuing with Chriſt: my firſt argument is, becauſe the Miniſter and people, Chriſt and his Church, did not <hi>aſſemble</hi> on the Lords day, vntill it was paſt or nere ended, Ioh. 20.19. their firſt meeting was in the euening of the Lords day; ſince their ſecond meeting vvas 8. dayes after, Ioh. 20.26. and their third, when they went to fiſhing, Ioh. 21.1.14. now aſſemblies &amp; congregations, vvere Sabbath dueties, Leuit. 23.2.3. wherefore, ſince the Miniſter &amp; people, Chriſt &amp; his Diſciples mett not all the day long, to ſolemnize it as a Sabbath, vntill euening &amp; the day vvas novv ſpent &amp; paſt, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they kept not this Lords day as a Sabbath. If it be obiected, that they could not aſſemble ſooner in the day, for feare of the Iewes, Ioh. 20.19. I anſwer, it is more likely, they durſt not ſtirr abroad all day lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, for feare of the Iewes; &amp; becauſe they feared the Iewes, therfore they kept cloſe all the day long together in the houſe; and ſo they were aſſembled all the day; but like ſheepe vvithout their Shepheard. 2. My ſecond argument wherwith I proue it, is becauſe they knew it not; they had no knowledge of it, that it was a Sabbath: and this I proue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not then, ſo much as beleeue that Chriſt was riſen from the dead: for this purpoſe ſee Mark. 16.11.9. where mention is made that Chriſt appeared firſt vnto Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene, &amp; the Text ſaith, that <hi>ſhe went and tould them that had bene with Chriſt, which mourned and wept; and when they heard that he was aliue, and had appeared to hir, they beleened it not:</hi> Againe, ſee Mark. 16.13. where is mention made of the two Diſciples that trauailed in to the country, &amp; how Chriſt appeared vnto
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:21140:108"/>them alſo, and the text ſaith of them; that <hi>they went and tould it vnto the remnant, neither beleeued they them:</hi> Laſtly, ſee Mar. 16.14. where the Text ſaith, <hi>finally, hee appeared vnto the eleuen, as they ſate together, and reproched them for their vnbeliefe &amp; hardneſſe of heart, becauſe they bleeued not them which had ſeene him, being riſen vp againe.</hi> S. Luke reporteth it thus, <hi>now it was Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene, &amp;c. which tould theſe things vnto the Apoſtles: But their words (ſaith the Text) ſeemed vnto them as a fained thing, neither beleeued they them:</hi> Luk. 24.10.11. So by all theſe Teſtimonies, you ſee it plaine, that the Church of Chriſt was ignorant of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, through vnbeliefe; not the eleuen; not the Apoſtles themſelues did beleeue it: Now I pray tell me, how theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles with the reſidue of the Diſciples, could Sanctify this Lords day, for a Sabbath day, in remembrance of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, vvhen as they knew not that Chriſt was riſen, and vvhen they beleeued it not? yea, tis yet more plaine that they were ignorant of the reſurrection; for the Scripture ſaith that they <hi>mourned and wept,</hi> ſtill, Mark. 16.10. And, that the two Diſciples that went to Emmaus, they had communication of Chriſt, and <hi>were ſade.</hi> Luk. 24.17. which ſadneſſe, mourning, and weeping, vpon the Lords day, yea when the day vvas fatr ſpent, Luk. 24.29. Bevvraieth that they were yet ignorant of the Lords reſurrection: how then, I maruaile, could they keepe that Lords day, from morning till night, in a ioyfull &amp; thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full remembrance of Chriſts reſurrection, when they knevv no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it? thus you ſee it apparent, that the Lords day, was not kept for a Sabbath day, conſtantly and vveekly in the dayes of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles: for this firſt Lords day vvas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected.</p>
                     <p>Neuertheleſſe it is not to be ſpoken, hovv confident our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are, that this Lords day, was conſtantly kept by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles; in ſo much as I haue heard, of ſome puritane Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that haue auowched it, that they vvill giue their liues, &amp; dye for the defence of this day: whither I may beleeue them or no I cannot tell: I ſhould thinke they vvould looke, before they leape, as the prouerb is: greate is the difference betvvixt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; doeing: I would faine beleeue them though; but this I
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21140:108"/>reſolue, if they proue ſo good as their vvords, &amp; be ſo vainly prodigall of their liues, they ſhall neuer haue my life in keeping. Will our Miniſters dye for the defence of the Lords day ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, vvhen the Apoſtles themſelues profaned it? for, the Apoſtles did not beleeue any ſuch matter, as if it vvere to be ſanctified, as you haue ſeene it proued: I truſt the people, vvill be ſo vviſe for themſelues in this point, as to giue their Miniſters leaue to dye firſt; But tis mine opinion, that we ſhall neuer ſee many Martyres for the Lords day.</p>
                     <p>One thing would be noted more, before vve leaue this point: It is ſuppoſed, that Chriſt touching the Redemption, did imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate God at the Creation, for the ſetting vp of a Sabbath, in memory thereof: well let vs ſee how like or rather vnlike, Chriſt was vnto God, in this matter; at the Creation God choſe the firſt Sabbath day, or 7th day, to be ſanctified: but we haue ſeene it plainly proued, that Chriſt choſe not the firſt Lords day, to be ſanctified. 2. God reſted himſelfe, on the firſt 7th day: But Chriſt trauailed vp &amp; downe the country, too and fro, on the firſt Lords day. 3. God gaue a ſpeciall com. the 4th com. for the Church to ſanctify the 7th day: But Chriſt, left no com. in all the New Teſtament for the Lords day. 4. God perſwaded his Church, by ſtrong reaſons, to the ſanctification of the 7th day, taken from his owne example, becauſe hee reſted on the 7th day; and becauſe hee bleſſed &amp; ſanctified the 7th day. But Chriſt neuer perſwaded his Church, by any reaſons, to keepe the Lords day, nor by his example; nay rather, he diſſvvaded them from ſanctifying of the Lords day, by his example, &amp; by the example of his Diſciples, recorded in Scripture; for they trauailed too &amp; fro vpon the Lords day; ſhewing vs thereby, that vve may doe the like. Foraſmuch therefore, as vve haue no com. in the Nevv Teſtament, for the ſanctifying of the Lords day, vve are left to follow examples: Now I find the example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> vpon the Lords day, farre vnlike to the example of God, on the 7th day; and therefore we may follow the example of Chriſt, and be as vnlike on the Lords day, to the example of God on the 7th day, as Chriſt was.</p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:21140:109"/>
                     <p> Againſt this, ſome Miniſters obiect thus; that happily the new Sabbath was not yet knovvne; the Church being in hir infancy; and Chriſt being newly riſen from the dead, things were not yet eſtabliſhed in the Church &amp;c. Herevnto I anſwer 1. if this new Sabbath was not knowne vpon this firſt Lords day; why then they graunt me, what I would haue, which is, that the Lords day, was not conſtantly &amp; weekly kept in the dayes of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, as now they vrge vs to keepe it euery where; and ſo they ouerthrow their owne doctrine. 2. This obiection maketh the matter worſe then it was before; for now they will to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their errour, caſt blame vpon Chriſt: for if this nevv Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was not knowne to the Church, no not this chiefe &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Lords day, whoſe fault was it, but Chriſts, in that hee being their Paſtour had not taught it them yet, no not when it was more then time, that they had knowne it, that ſo they might haue kept it.</p>
                     <p>The Lords day, being inſtituted by Chriſt, to be kept for a Sabbath day, in remembrance of our Redemption (as our new Sabbatharians imagine) it could not but make as much for the Memory of Chriſt his death, as the Lords Supper did, of which Chriſt ſaied, <hi>doe this in remembrance of mee:</hi> now can any man thinke that Chriſt could paſſe ouer the doctrine of this, a point of ſuch conſequence, &amp; that in ſo ſeaſonable a time, vvhithout ſome neglect, if there had bene any ſuch thing to be taught them? they cannot plead, that Chriſt could not conveniently come at his Diſciples, erly enough in the morning, to haue min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them of it: for he roſe very erly, &amp;c. neither wanted he meanes to haue ſent them vvord of it: for he ſent them word by Mary Magdalene, that they ſhould goe downe into Galile, and there they ſhould ſee him, Mat. 28.1.10. hee might as eaſily haue ſent them vvord alſo, that it was his will, that they ſhould keepe that preſent day for a Sabbath, if euer he had intended any ſuch matter. 3. I anſwer, that this obiection ſpoiles all, for if through infancy of the Church, and the like, (as ſome infant-like-men imagine) this firſt Lords day, was not inſtituted for a Sabbath, whither I maruaile then, vvill they rune for an inſtitution? for there is not any mention in the Scriptures, of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:21140:109"/>any word of inſtitution; nor of any practiſe or example, of Chriſt or of any of the Apoſtles, about their ſanctifying any Lords day after this firſt Lords day, vntill <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> day, Act. 2. vvhich was 6 or 7 vveekes after this firſt Lords day: ſo here then, is a greater errour; for not onely the firſt Lords day vvas omitted for a Sabbath, but alſo, there is no footing for any Lords day kept like a Sabbath, for 6 or 7 weekes together, after Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
                     <p>Thus the further vve ſerch in to this point, the more vaine it doth appeare, in ſo much as it irketh me to blot ſo much paper, as I haue done, and muſt doe, to anſwer to ſuch an idle argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as is the Lords day Sabbath: &amp; it vexeth me to ſee, men of ſuch able partes for lerning &amp; naturall endovvments, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noumed for ſanctity, thus to befoole themſelues, in the defence of ſuch a friuolouſe tenet as is this Lords day Sabbath: But it fareth with them as I thinke, like men that haue had wrong poſſeſſion a long time; when the true owner comes to claime his right; yet ſince they haue poſſeſt it ſo long, they will invent ſomthing to defend it ſtill; they vvill find trickes, quilites, and quirkes in the Lavv, to hould poſſeſſion ſtill againſt the true ovvner: ſo it is here, the Lords day, hath thruſt out the Lords Sabbath day, from poſſeſſion, novv this many yeeres; and ſince it is done, &amp; the Lords day hath, &amp; hath had the poſſeſſion long, ſome culler muſt be ſet on the matter, ſomthing muſt be invented to maintaine poſſeſſion ſtill, though neuer ſo vvrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; though neuer ſo to the ſhame of the defenders of it.</p>
                     <p>But for all this, they are redy to reply thus, but vvhat is the matter that this Lords day, is ſo often repeated in the Nevv Teſtament, aboue any other day of the vveeke? and vvhy vvere ſuch notable vvorkes ſtill done vpon that day; as Chriſt roſe then; and appeared to his Diſciples; the Holy Ghoſt deſcended Act. 2. Peter preacht and converted thovvſands; Paul preacht on that day; and here vvas a Collection for the poore on that day; &amp; S. John receiued a Reuelation vpon the ſame day, now all this cannot but point at ſomething, &amp;c. Where vnto I anſvver, tis true all theſe doe point at ſome thing; but vvhat is the thing vvhich they point vnto? they ſhould tell vs vvhat thing they
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:21140:110"/>point vnto, &amp; not ſay onely, they point at ſomething: I doubt not but they point at ſomething, but vvithall I beleeue they point at nothing for their purpoſe, to helpe to proue the conſtant vveekly practiſe of the Lords day for a Sabbath, if they did, they vvould not be aſhamed to ſay what they point vnto in particular, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it off thus in generall termes, all theſe point at ſomething: In the night time, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had a reuelation, concerning Chriſt, Mat. 1.20. Mat. 2.13.14. In the night, Chriſt came vnto his Diſciples, vvalking myraculouſly on the Sea, Mat. 14.25. In the night time Chriſt vvas betraied, Mark. 14.27. In the night time, vvas brought by the Angel to the Shepheards, thoſe moſt ioyfull tydinges of a Sauiour borne into the vvorld, Luk. 2.8. In the night Paul &amp; Silas ſung Pſalmes vnto God, Act. 16.25. In the night Paul preached at Troas, &amp; raiſed vp Eutychus falne dovvne dead, Act. 20.7.8.9. Novv all theſe you may ſay, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſomething indeed, &amp; true it is: But tell vs, &amp; proue it vnto vs, what is that ſomthing? they will not ſay, we muſt hence learne to keepe Popiſh <hi>Vigiles,</hi> or holy nightes, I truſt. 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ſpeake of the often repetition of the Lords day, in the Nevv Teſtament; the Sabbath day, is oftener repeated then it: tis true, the 4 Euangeliſts doe euery one of them mention it, but all that, is but as if it vvere once mentioned onely; for the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts doe but mention one &amp; the ſame thing, albeit it be 4 times repeated by them all: that there are more Sabbath dayes ſpake of, then Lords dayes, ſee theſe textes, Act. 13.14.42.44. Act. 16.13. Act. 17.2. Act. 18.4.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, vvhereas they make ſome greate matter of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there vvere ſo many notable vvorkes done vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Lords day, &amp; this point is much in their mouthes: J anſvver, 1. the day vvheron notable vvorkes vvere done, is vſually put dovvne in Scripture for the more certainty ſake: novv to enquire after other reaſons &amp; ends, vvhereof the Scripture is ſilent, is prying curioſity, &amp; to affirme any other ends, is preſumption. Ezekiel the Prophet had a reuelation, or a viſion, on the fifth day, of the 4th moneth, Ezek. <hi>1.1.</hi> Novv vvho can tell me, vvhy he had his viſion, on the fifth day, rather then on the firſt: or in the 4th moneth, rather then in the 5th or 6th moneth? Eliah had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:21140:110"/>in the third yeere, 1. King. 18.1. Hezekiah, that godly King, began to raigne, on the third yeere, 2. King. 18.1. who can giue a reaſon why theſe notable workes fell out ſtill vpon the third yeere? In the 7th moneth, the Arcke reſted vpon the Mount Ararat, Geneſ. 8.4. on the 7th moneth; they had a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne faſt day, Leuit. 16.29. on the 7th moneth, they had a Sabbath, Leuit. 23.24. in the 7th moneth, the trumpet for the Iubile was blowne, Leuit. 25.9. now what wiſe man, can tell why God did theſe things, ſtill on the 7th moneth, rather then on the eight, or nynth moneth, vnleſſe the Scripture had reueal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it? theſe are idle braines vanities.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſwer, if theſe notable workes done in the Lords day, ſhould ſanctify the day &amp; time, for euer after, why ſhould they not haue power, to ſanctify the place alſo, wherin they were<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done? for theſe workes ſhould aſwell ſanctify place, as time, in common reaſon: and ſo <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſhould be the Holy place ſtill, for Gods worſhip; as well as the <hi>Lords day,</hi> be the Holy time, for Gods worſhip: for, were not all theſe notable workes, done in the place of Ieruſalem, as well as in the time of Lords day? did not Chriſt riſe from the dead there? did he not appeare to his Diſciples there? did not the Holy Ghoſt deſcend there, in Ieruſalem? did not Peter preach, &amp; convert thowſands there? &amp; did not Chriſt ſuffer there?</p>
                     <p>But happily they may thinke, that theſe notable workes, had more power ouer the circumſtance of the time, then of the place; and therfore to ſatisfy them, in all their fopperies, vve muſt ſpeake of the time, becauſe the queſtion is for ſooth about time: well then for time; if theſe notable workes, had power to ſanctify, or to declare as ſanctified, the Lords day, the Firſt day of the weeke; then why ſhould they not ſanctify or declare as Sanctified the yeere, that is, the firſt yeere of euery ſeauen, from the firſt yeere of our Lord, hitherto, and ſo vve ſhould keepe euery firſt yeere, of euery 7 yeeres, for a Sabbath yeere, in memory of the Redemption: like as the Iewes kept euery 7th yeere a Sabbath yeere, Leuit. 25.4. for the reaſon is the ſame, &amp; as good, that we ſhould keepe euery firſt yeere in 7. as well as euery firſt day, in 7. for the reaſon why they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:21140:111"/>would haue euery firſt day a Sabbath, is becauſe ſuch notable workes were done in the firſt day of the weeke, the Lords day; well then, &amp; why ſhould we not haue the firſt yeere of the 7 a Sabbath yeere alſo? for the ſelfe ſame notable workes, that were done in the Lords day, or Firſt day of the weeke; the ſelfe ſame notable workes were done in the firſt yeere of our Lord: for in this yeere Chriſt roſe from the dead; in this yeere he appeared to his Diſciples very frequently; in this yeere the Holy Ghoſt deſcended; in this yeere Peter preached, and converted thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; in this yeere Chriſt aſcended vp into heauen; why ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould we not haue this firſt yeere a Sabbath, as vvell as the Firſt day? ſince the reaſon is one and the ſame in both?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I anſwer, they erre, and that by applying theſe notable workes, done on the Lords day, to vſes and ends whereof the Scripture giueth them not the leaſt light: for they apply all theſe notable vvorkes, vnto the time &amp; day, wherein they were done; as if they did ſhew &amp; declare this time &amp; this day to be a more holy time, and a more holy day, then other dayes and times; and by name, that it muſt be a Sabbath day too: whereas the Spirit of God, intendeth no ſuch matter, in recording theſe vvorkes that we can find, but thereby aimeth at other ends: as for example, the reaſon vvhy Chriſt roſe on the Lords day, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then on any day after, might be, leaſt that he ſhould <hi>ſee corruption,</hi> Act. 2.27. and a reaſon why hee appeared to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples vpon this Lords day, rather then vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any day after, might be, leaſt his Diſciples ſhould diſpaire in him, ſaying, he is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp of death: and alſo Chriſt appeared to them on that very day, to put an end to their ſorrow and mourning for him, as ſoone as might be; for vnto that very day, the Diſciples were ſadd for him, yea they mourned for him, and wept, Luk. 24.17. Mark. 16.10. yea, Chriſt appeared on the Lords day, to fulfill &amp; make good his own prophecies, of himſelfe, before his death, as that Mat. 12.40. as Ionas was 3 dayes &amp; 3 nights in the whales belly; ſo ſhall the ſonne of man be 3 dayes &amp; 3 nights in the heart of the earth. And, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in 3 dayes I will raiſe it vp againe,</hi> Ioh. 2.19.21. It was needfull therefore,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21140:111"/>that both Chriſt ſhould riſe on the Lords day, it being the third day from his Paſſion; and alſo that he ſhould ſhew himſelfe being riſen, to his Diſciples, vpon this third day, to make good his owne words.</p>
                     <p>And for the holy Ghoſts deſcent vpon this day, Act. 2.1. it being Pentecoſt day, a great feaſt day of the Iewes, wherein were mert at Ieruſalem many ſtrangers; and on which day, all the people of the Citty were at home, not abroad in the fields; and were more apt to aſſemble and gather together to take knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this myracle, therefore as it is moſt likly, did the holy Ghoſt chooſe this day, rather then any other to ſhew this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; to grace &amp; countenance the Goſpell, in the ſight of all men, and to add authority vnto the Apoſtles doctrine before all men, that they might be wone to the faith; and what notable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it tooke you ſee, for thowſands of the people aſſembling to ſee the myracle vpon Peters ſermon inſtantly made vnto them, were conuerted, Act. 2.14.41. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Peters</hi> ſermon vpon this day, it was meerly occationall, as namely to take off the ſlaunder of drunkenneſſe, caſt vpon the Apoſtles, Act. 2.13. and to informe thoſe that doubted of this myracle, what it ſhould meane, Act. 2.12. but to ſuppoſe the holy Ghoſt deſcended, to make this day a Sabbath, is an idle fiction, &amp; fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inuention. Hereby you may ſee how they wring and wreſt the Scriptures, vnto ſuch vſes, as the holy Ghoſt neuer intended, &amp; whereof the holy Scripture is altogether ſilent: who made theſe men of Gods priuy Counſaile, that they ſhould be ſo well acquainted with ſuch ends of the holy Ghoſts actions, as he hath concealed? ſuch interpreters of holy Scripture, if they had their due, would be ſent backe to the Uniuerſity againe, to learne more Logicke, or confined to their ſtudies, for a ſeaſon, that they might grow better acquainted with the holy Scriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be permitted to make publike interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of them: they let not to damne men, to the pit of hell, for not keeping this Lords day conſtantly for a Sabbath, and that vpon theſe idle grownds; were it fit to put a ſword into a mans hand, that knovves not when or vvhere to vſe it? ſhould theſe men be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted vvith the keyes, to ſhut men out of heauen, and to locke men into hell, thus cauſleſly?</p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:21140:112"/>
                     <p> By what hath bene ſaid, it appeareth 1. that it can no where be proued, that the Lords day, was in Chriſts &amp; the Apoſtles times, kept conſtantly &amp; weekly for a Sabbath day. 2. That the firſt Lords day, was not kept for a Sabbath day, by Chriſt, nor by his Apoſtles &amp; Diſciples: Wherefore it followeth, that if this Lords day, was not kept conſtantly &amp; vveekly in the dayes of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, then we are not tyed in conſcience in imitation of their examples, to keepe euery Lords day, vveeke by vveeke, as now we doe: it is ſufficient if vve keepe but ſome Lords day, ſometime; as one in a yeere, or one in thre moneths, or one in 6 moneths, or the like; but a vveekly obſeruation is a needleſſe &amp; growndleſſe obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſince it cannot be ſhowne, nor proued in the holy Scriptures. Thus much touching the Scriptures: Novv a vvord or two out of the Hiſtories of the Church.</p>
                     <p>We reade it mentioned by <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Perkins</hi> in his firſt Volume, vpon the 4th com. pag. 48. that <hi>the Lords day</hi> (vvhich he there cales Sabbath day) <hi>was neglected, and not obſerued by thoſe primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Churches, which liued next after the Apoſtles, vntill it was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Chriſtian Emperours &amp;c.</hi> Thus you ſee, the Lords day, vvas not obſerued by many of the primitiue Churches, for 300 yeeres; for ſo long it was ere Conſtantine enacted a law for it, who was a Chriſtian Emperour: Now who can imagine, that the Lords day, was euer kept in the Apoſtles dayes, weekly and conſtantly, for a Sabbath day, when as thoſe Chriſtian Churches, who immediatly ſucceded the Apoſtles, kept it not at all for 300 yeeres together? is it credible that thoſe pureſt Churches ſhould neglect ſuch an ordinance of Chriſt, as the Lords day Sabbath, if any ſuch ordinance there had euer bene in the Church? No, no, the vveekly &amp; conſtant obſeruation of the Lords day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, it is but a nouelty, and lately ſprung vp.</p>
                     <p>The vſe I vvould make of this point is this; is it ſo, that the Scriptures doe not bind vs to a vveekly keping of the Lords day, but that it is enough, if vvee keepe it at ſome times onely; Why then doe Miniſters preſſe the people ſo hardly to keepe euery Lords day, and euery Sunday, none excepted? may it not in this reſpect, be ſaid of theſe Miniſters, as the Lord ſpake of

                           </gap> they ranne: I haue not ſpoken to them, and yet they prophecied?</hi> Ier. 23.21. Why are theſe Miniſters more ſtrict then God himſelfe? why doe they preſſe to a vveekly practiſe, when Gods vvord ſpeaketh but of a ſeldome practiſe? Why ſhould vve be tied to keepe the Lords day oftener, then did the Apoſtolike Churches? Foraſmuch as vve are bound to keepe but ſome Lords dayes in a yeere, vvhy are people hindred in the time of harueſt, to gather in their corne on the Lords day, &amp; that vpon payne of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if they doe; &amp; vpon pretenſe of a breach of the 4th com.? ſince they may, both worke on euery Lords day, all the time of harueſt, &amp; yet keepe ſome Lords dayes after harueſt is done. Alſo in the time of wheat ſeile &amp; barly-ſeile, why may not the huſbandman plow his ground, &amp; ſome his ſeede, on the Lords day? ſince he may keepe ſome Lords day in a yeere, after theſe buſy times be paſt. In the time of Hay-ſeile, vvhy ſhould not men make their haye on the Lords day? ſeeing they may keepe Lords dayes enough all the yeere after. When a Fayer fales vpon the Lords day, why may they not keepe it vpon that day? or if it fale vpon the Monday, why may they not ride to it, &amp; driue cartes to it, on the Lords day, the day before it; as vvell as Chriſts Diſciples trauailed 15 myles vpon the Lords day, and vpon the moſt eminent Lords day? ſince they may keepe ſome Lords dayes, on the other times of the yeere, vvhen there is no fayer.</p>
                     <p>It is true, I verily beleeue, that the 7th day, Saturday Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, is ſtill in force, and that I beare a reuerence &amp; a religiouſe reſpect vnto that day; and for the conſcience, and duety I ovve vnto it, I doe ſanctify the Lords day, not for it ſelfe, but for the Sabbath dayes ſake, vvhich goeth before it, giuing God one day for an other, by vvay of a change, vntill the time of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they did change the Paſſeouer day, Numb. 9.1.3.11. It is alſo true, that moſt of our Miniſters hould the 7th day, Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath, for a ceremony &amp; aboliſhed: novv could I be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in my conſcience, that the 7th day Sabbath is aboliſhed, as they ſay they are, I doe proteſt it, that I vvould not make any conſcience or ſcruple, of doeing the ordenary vvorkes of the 6.

Chriſts Diſciples, made this Lords day, a trauailing day: &amp; alſo Chriſt him ſelfe trauailed in it too &amp; fro, as hath bene proued, wherefore, if vve may receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from Gods 4th com: or if vve may follovv the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, &amp; of his Diſciples, then may vve ſafly doe the vvorkes of our calings on the Lords day, as vvell as vpon any other day of the weeke.</p>
                     <p>But herevnto ſome of our Miniſters, as thoſe who are ſo hote for the Lords day Sabbath, will be redy to reply &amp; ſay; But Sir, you giue too great liberty to our people; you lay the reines vpon their necke; &amp; you ſpeake moſt profanly &amp;c. to whom I anſwer, I know indeed that it is full ſore againſt their wills, that I haue diſcouered this ſecret vnto their people; for they had rather haue ploded on in their old errour deceiuing the people ſtill, then this light ſhould haue bene ſeene; but for my part, I had rather pleaſe God, then pleaſe men, Knovving, that God cannot away with it, that his Miniſters ſhold teach for his Doctrines, their owne inventiones &amp; Traditiones: I Know well, that they doe daily reuile me, &amp; reproch me, &amp; ſay all manner of euill againſt me falfly, before their people; that ſo
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:21140:113"/>my perſon being brought into contempt, that which I ſpeake againſt their new Sabbath, may be contemned likewiſe: but I deſire them to forbeare ſuch vnchriſtian &amp; cuning courſes; I deſire them that they would no more backbite me, &amp; ſlaunder me behind my backe, vvhere I cannot come to anſvver for my ſelfe: but this is a more faire courſe, vvich I vvill propound vnto them: if they thinke in deede &amp; in trueth that I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen too greate libertie vnto their people, &amp; haue done vvrong vnto their nevv Sabbath; then let them put pen to paper, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this booke: ſo they ſhall bevvray to the vvorld, that they ſpeake as they thinke, vvhen they ſo bitterly inueigh againſt me, &amp; againſt my booke: euery ſilly creature can ſay tis an errour, tis a foule errour, tis an abominable errour, &amp; tis a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed booke &amp; an hundreth more; but I would haue Miniſters that are ſchollers, leaue vvords, &amp; fale to blovves; let them confute the booke: neither doe I exhorte them to this, as a matter at their choiſe, to doe it or not to doe it; but I vrge it vpon them as a duetie both to man, and to God: it is their duetie in reſpect of men, becauſe they haue ſo confidently taught them that this day is the Sabbath day, and that vpon payne of damnation they are bound to ſanctify it, in conſcience of the 4th com. vvherefore either they muſt acknovvledg that they haue bene in an errour, &amp; labour ſo ſoone as they can to reforme it; which is parte of amends, &amp; an argument of an honeſt minde: or elſe they muſt defend it, that ſo their people may ſee, that they play not faſt &amp; looſe with them; that they teach them no more in the pulpit, then they will be redy to defend by their pen, if any oppoſe it; I cannot ſee how they can defend themſelues for honeſt men, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they doe thus: it is not enough for them, to belch out now &amp; then ſome reprochfull words, &amp; with a kinde of ſcorne and diſdaine, to vilifie the booke &amp; the Author of it; euery foole can anſwer a booke ſo.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo their duetie in reſpect of God; for they ſay that I am in a foule errour; and that the Lords day, is a conſtant Sabbath, of Gods inſtitution: Well then, and will they not defend Gods cauſe? who ſhould ſtand vp for God, if Gods Miniſters will not? wherefore haue they both their liuings, and their office of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:21140:114"/>but to manage Gods cauſes, &amp; defend them againſt all oppoſitions? vvill they (thinke you) giue their liues in defence of this Lords day, as they tell their people they will, who will not giue their labours to defend it? when as Peter the Apoſtle, did but by his example, bring in Iudaiſme, into the Church of Antiochia, Paul the Apoſtle, <hi>withſtood him to his face; and reproued him before all men,</hi> Gal. 2.11.14. If therefore I, like Peter, haue offended againſt the Lords day, then they like Paul, in zeale of Gods glorie, ſhould riſe vp to confute me, <hi>before all men:</hi> elſe they cannot iuſtify themſelues (ſo farre as I can ſee) to be faithfull in their places, and to be followers of the Apoſtles. As for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, me thinke, they ſhould neuer ceaſe preſſing of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, by theſe &amp; the like arguments, to the anſwer of this booke, for the quieting of their conſciences, and for the cleering of the trueth in this point: they ſhould <hi>ſay vnto Archippus, take heede vnto the miniſterie, that thou haſt receiued in the Lord, that thou ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill it,</hi> Col. 4.17. vnleſſe they deſire to liue in ignorance and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and in doubt which is the trueth. It is true, it hath bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to me, that ſome of theſe 10 Miniſters haue bene thus moued by their people, but they haue returned this anſwer: Wee? What wee? ſhall vvee anſwer his vaine booke? let ſome Cobler, Tayler, or Shomaker anſwer it &amp;c. and are not theſe lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſpirits? who could forbeare to reproue them <hi>openly,</hi> that knoweth them in an errour, in a foule and groſſe errour, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſufficient meanes of conuiction tendred vnto them, both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly &amp; publikely, and done alſo in all meekneſſe and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: &amp; for all this, they ſtill perſiſt, &amp; carry it out in the height of pride, ſcorning &amp; diſdaining him that ſhall in loue &amp; reſpect vnto their perſons admoniſh them, as my former booke will witneſle for me? So much be ſpoken touching the former queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein you ſee that they cannot proue it, that euery Lords day or Sunday, was kept for a Sabbath in the Apoſtles dayes, as now they are.</p>

                     <p>I come now vnto the ſecond maine queſtion, which is to know, whither it can be proued that any one Lords day, is a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:21140:114"/>Sabbath day, by Gods ordinance, or not. For, I deny not only that euery Lords day is a Sabbath conſtantly, and weeke by weeke: but alſo I deny that there is ſo much as any one Lords day, a Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p>For the better ſcaning of this point, I will examine all their Scriptures, &amp; all their reaſons, which they produce in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt for their Scriptures; I haue reade ouer many the workes and writings of the patrons of this Lords day, to ſee their grownds for it, but yet among all the textes of Scripture which they alleage, I can no where find a <hi>Commandement</hi> for it alleag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, out of any parte of the new Teſtament: and this ſeemeth to me a ſtraung thing: if you demaund of them who is the Authour of this new Sabbath, they will tell you Chriſt: in the next place, if you demaund of them, where Chriſt left any commandement for it, by himſelfe, or by his Apoſtles; here they are at a <hi>non plus,</hi> they can finde no com. for it in all the new Teſtament; no nor any <hi>exhortation</hi> to keepe it; nor <hi>promiſe</hi> or <hi>threatening</hi> to thoſe who keepe, or profane it: now this at the firſt entrance, doth breede a ſhrewd ſuſpition, that this new Sabbath, is but ſome forgery, when there is neither comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, nor exhortation for it in the booke of God; neither promiſe to them who keepe it, nor threatening to them who profane it; when the old Sabbath was ſet vp, it was done by an expreſſe Commandement; and can there a new Sabbath come into its roome, with out a Commandement? was God more carefull to inſtitute a Sabbath in memory of the Creation, then Chriſt was to ſet vp a Sabbath in memory of the Redemption?</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, the new ordinances which Chriſt ſet vp in the Goſpell, as <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> Chriſt was mindfull to leaue commandements for them expreſly; as for Baptiſme, <hi>Goe therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 28.19. &amp; for the Lords Supper, <hi>Take, eate: this is my body whith is broken for you</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 11.24.26. now this <hi>Lords day,</hi> is affirmed by them, to be an ordinance of the Goſpell, &amp; a new ordinance of the new Teſtament, &amp; inſtituted in memory of the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; &amp; is it likely that Chriſt would leaue commandements for ſome of his new ordinances, &amp; not for the reſt? This Lords
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21140:115"/>day, (if it be, as they make vs beleeue) it may well be counted by the Church a third Sacrament; for it is to be kept in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt, like as are the two other Sacraments of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, &amp; the Lords Supper: yea, and this new Sabbath, wich is or may well be, a nevv Sacrament alſo, is of as great vſe, if not of greater, then the tvvo Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper: for, Baptiſme remembreth a man of Chriſt but once in his life time, in a ſpeciall ſorte: &amp; the Lords ſupper, putteth vs in minde of Chriſts death but once a quarter; but this nevv Sabbath, &amp; nevv Sacrament, ſhould put vs in minde of Chriſt once a weeke; ſo as this vvould be very vſefull aboue the others; novv can vvee thinke, that Chriſt vvould be ſo mindfull as to leaue Comm. for the ij Sacraments, &amp; be altogether vnmindfull to leaue a commandement, for the Lords day, to be a Sabbath, if euer he had meant it ſhould be a Sabbath? and for the Apoſtles, ſome fanſy that Chriſt left a commandement vvith them, Act. 1.2. but let it then be ſhovvne; vvhere is it vvritten I marueile? nay, can vve thinke that if Curiſt had giuen the Apoſtles a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to deliuer to the Church, that they durſt haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it? could this haue ſtood vvith their faithfulneſſe? The conſideration of this one point, is enough to make any man to ſtagger, &amp; the vvhole building to totter: their caſe is aboue 50 in the 100 the vvorſe for this, that they are inforced at the firſt onſet, to confeſſe, that they can ſhevv no commandement for the Lords day, from either Chriſt the founder of it, or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: The Saturday Sabbath, hath a commandement to authoriſe it; but the Sunday Sabbath hath none; vvherefore I ſhall make my choiſe of the Saturday Sabbath, let them that liſt, chooſe the Sunday Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>Hence this one note vvould be obſerued, that ſince there is no Commandement for the Lords day, therfore it followeth, that the Patrones thereof, muſt fetch all their grownds for it, by reaſon, collections, &amp; conſequences out of Scripture; now how feeble a thing mans blind reaſons is, vvho knoweth not, that knowes himſelfe? how liable are vve to miſtake; yea how ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to <hi>fallacies</hi> &amp; to be deceiued thereby, are the beſt Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans, eſpecially in the Matters of God: ſo that if reaſon may
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21140:115"/>poſſibly err, &amp; be deceiued, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may they be deceiued that ſtand for the Lords day, yea though I in ſtead of oppoſition, ſhould ioyne with them, &amp; all men ſay Amen to them: for reaſon and conſequences are their beſt guide &amp; direction: ſo then at the beſt, the foundation of our Lords day Sabbath, hath but the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy foundation of mans blinde &amp; ſhallow reaſon.</p>
                     <p>But here vnto they are redy to reply, that neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence out of Scripture, is as ſound as Scripture it ſelfe: vvhere vnto I anſwer, 1. That the compariſon made of mans reaſon, with Gods vvord, is vnbefitting; for be it that neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is ſound, and very ſound; yet, ſeing conſequence is by force of manes reaſon, it is not fit that it ſhould be compared &amp; equalled with the neuer erring vvord of God. 2. I anſwer, tis true that neceſſary conſequence is very ſound indeed, but then the difficulty is, to knovv, when a conſequence is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily true, and vvhen not: for many men take their conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be neceſſarily true, which are but contingent and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully true: But to paſſe by this point, let it be noted, that theſe men vvho doe ſo aduance mens reaſon, and conſequences, and talke ſo much for conſequences, and of neceſſary conſequences; thers no men vſe neceſſary conſequences leſſe then they doe; in ſomuch as I begine to queſtion it, that they talke beyond their skill, vvhen they talke ſo before the people, of neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; for, if they knew vvhat they ſaid, vvhen they ſo ſpeake, vve ſhould ſinde them vſe this neceſſary conſequence, in their diſputations, and arguments framed by them for the Lords day Sabbath: for, it is in this argument, and vpon this occation, that they talke ſo of neceſſary conſequences; thereby inſinuating vnto common people, that they haue neuer erring <hi>Neceſſary</hi> conſequence, for their Lords day Sahbath: But heere I challeng them, any of them all, to ſhew me but one argument, out of any Text of Scripture for the Lords day Sabbath, vvhich ſtandes by force of <hi>neceſſary</hi> conſequence: vvhich if they can not doe, as I know vvell they cannot doe it, then are they but vngodly bragadoceans &amp; proud boaſters, to prattle of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequences, as if forſooth they meant it, to proue all they ſay by neceſſary conſequence, but when they come to it, they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:21140:116"/>flinch, giue in, and doe nothing leſſe; this is but one of their trickes, to delude the people withall.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe vve are vpon the point, let me ſhew you ſome of their neceſſary conſequences; as 1. Chriſt appeared to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples vpon the Lords day; Therefore the Lords day muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be a Sabbath day. 2. Chriſt roſe vpon the Lords day, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, euery Lords day after, muſt neceſſarily be a Sabbath. 3. The holy Ghoſt deſcended on the Lords day; ergo, it cannot poſſibly be otherwiſe, but it muſt be a Sabbath. 4. Peter preached once on the Lords day, &amp; at an other time, I know not how many yeeres after, Paul preached a ſermon too on the Lords day; Therefore of neceſſity it muſt be a Sabbath day. 5. There vvas a collection for the poore on the Lords day. Therefore it muſt be a Sabbath, a poore conſequence. 6. It vvas called the Lords day, therefore it muſt be a Sabbath day. As much as if they had argued thus neceſſarily, it vvas called Sunday; therefore it muſt be Saturday. Theſe &amp; the like are the neceſſary conſequences, which they vſe, who talke ſo much of neceſſary conſequence; the very mention whereof, is enough to loath a mans ſtomake, vnto vomiting.</p>
                     <p>Here cometh in an obiection; ſay they, if you muſt haue a command. for the Lords day, ſhew vs you then, where we haue a com. for the Baptiſme of infantes. 1. I anſwer, you doe vvell to confeſſe that you haue no comm. for your Lords day, for it is ſo indeed. 2. If you aſke me vvhere vve haue any com. to baptize infants, my anſvver is, that I neuer reade of any yet; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I take it to be an indifferent thing, at the libertie of the Church, to baptiſe vvhen infants, or of riper yeeres: if therefore, you can ſhew a Com. for Baptiſme of infants vvhich I cannot, then is there reaſon you ſhould alſo ſhew a Com. for your Lords day; but if you can ſhew none, no more then I, then is your Lords day, but an indifferent thing, and at the liberty of the Church as Baptiſme of infants is: this is a rule, that vvhat is not commaunded nor forbidden, that is indifferent: ſo then, as the Church may baptiſe one ſooner, or later; ſo the Church may keepe your Lords day, and they may refuſe to keepe it, if they pleaſe: and this is the higheſt pitch of honour that you can
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:21140:116"/>raiſe your Lords day to, that it is an indifferent thing, ſo as the Church may Reſt vpon it or vvorke vpon it; keepe it, or refuſe to keepe it, at hir pleaſure: for, a commaunded thing or day, it is not by your owne confeſſion.</p>

                     <p>Furthermore if theſe men could ſee, but that they cannot, ſo long as they thinke, <hi>wiſedome muſt dye</hi> vvith them, vvhilſt they goe about to ſtrengthen their Lords day Sabbath by the 4th Com. they therby vveaken it, in the ſight of all vviſe men: For beſids vvhat hath bene ſaid to this purpoſe, themſelues doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvray it that their cauſe is feeble, and vvanteth ſtrength &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation; for their conſciences tell them, that the Lords day, needeth a Commandement; and their eyes tell them, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles left none for it in all the Nevv Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; vvherefore, to make vp that vvhich is lacking by Chriſt, themſelues haue ſupplied it, by runing into the Old Teſtament for a Com. for it: thus they intimate, that Chriſt vvas not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Lavv-giuer, becauſe he gaue none for the Lords day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: and further they doe bevvray, that they cannot finde ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments ſufficient &amp; enough for the Lords day, neither from Chriſt, nor from the Apoſtles, nor in all the Nevv Teſtament: for elſe they vvould as vvell content themſelues, vvith ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as they find in the Nevv Teſtament for it, as in other new ordinances they doe; they rune not into the Old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to proue the doctrine of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt, of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> Wherefore they bewray that the Lords day is not grownded in the New Teſtament, as is the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Baptiſme, and the Lords ſupper: this kind of Sophiſtry is much like vnto this; ſuppoſe a Lawyer ſhould affirme it, that it is vnlavvfull for an vſurer, to take aboue 8. in the 100. and the vſurer ſhould demaund againe of him, vvhen that Law was made, &amp; by vvhom, &amp; what King vvas the Authour &amp; founder

Would not any man whoſe eyes are in his heade thinke the Lawyer doth but fumble?

By this diuiſe, may we reuiue all the Ceremoniall Lawes in the Old Teſtament, ſaying they bind vs novv analogically, which is flat contrary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Apoſtle, Epheſ. 2.15. Colo. 2.14.5. The fourth com. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bind to the Lords day being a new day, analogically: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sabbath day, which is the old day, is not yet aboliſhed, as ſhall be ſhowne, and ſo it muſt bind ſtill to the old day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. Other anſwers there be alſo in my other booke of the Sabbath, vvhich here I omit, for I purpoſe not to ſtand vpon this point, becauſe I thinke few or none will vrge it.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, let vs come to them that are aſhamed of nothing; for they hould that the 4th com. binds to the Lords day properlie: &amp; theſe haue many deuices to deceiue themſelues &amp; others; as ſometimes they haue this argument, that the Hebrew word Sabbath ſignifieth a reſt, novv on the Lords day, vve Reſt; &amp; therfore the 4th Com. belongeth vnto it. Hereto I anſwer, 1. that the word Sabbath vſed in the 4th Com. vvas neuer vſed for a Reſt generally vpon any day, but <hi>Synecdochically,</hi> for a Reſt particularly, vpon the 7th day onely. 2. By the like reaſon, vve may hould ffaſt dayes, &amp; Chriſtmas day, and Coronation dayes, Sabbathes, by the 4th Com. alſo: for on theſe dayes vve Reſt alſo.</p>
                     <p>Others haue this for an argument, they affirme that by Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, &amp; 7th day, in the Com. may be meante not the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, &amp; the 7th day, but a Sabbath, &amp; a 7th day: &amp; are not theſe thoſe neceſſary conſequences whereof they talke ſo? To vvit, becauſe theſe words Sabbath, &amp; 7th, may be vnderſtood of a Sabbath, and of a 7th day, that Therfore they muſt ſo be taken: with them then, this is a neceſſary conſequence, that, vvhat may
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:21140:118"/>be, muſt of neceſſity be: it may be, it ſhall raine too morrow; doth it therfore follow that for certaine it neceſſarily muſt raine too morrow? but theſe friuolouſe &amp; childiſh arguments, my ſtomacke is ſo loathed with them, as I vvill proceed no further, hauing in my expoſition vpon the 4th com. ſufficiently diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe vanities.</p>
                     <p>The third argument, is. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Chappels</hi> which he deliuered in publike; thus he argueth: <hi>If one day in Seauen, muſt be a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and not the Seauenth day; then the Lords day, muſt be the Sabbath day: But one day in 7, muſt be a Sabbath day, &amp; not the 7th day: Therfore the Lords day, muſt be the Sabbath day.</hi> As for the conſequence, this he proued by this argument; becauſe the Lords day is the fiteſt of all the ſixe: and that becauſe there was a weekly collection theron, 1. Cor. 16.2. with other the like Textes, which are vſed in defence of the Lords day ordenarily: but I omit anſwer to this proofe of his conſequence, in this place, becauſe I ſhall haue hereafter a more fit place to anſwer this argument, that the Lords day is the fiteſt, &amp;c. In this place I vvill onely anſwer his maine argument, vvhich growndeth vpon the 4th Com. for this is our taske in this Section, to deale vvith the 4th com. onely.</p>
                     <p>I come to his Minor, which conſiſteth of two partes; <hi>But one day in ſeauen, muſt be a Sabbath day; &amp; not the 7th day:</hi> for the former parte of it, in theſe words, <hi>But one day in ſeauen; muſt be a Sabbath day:</hi> for proofe of this hee alleaged my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and the Teſtimony of thoſe of the ſame iudgement with me, ſaying, as for this parte of my Minor, themſelues confeſſe it: for they hould that one daye in ſeauen, muſt be a Sabbath: but hoe there M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Chappell, you muſt not carry it away ſo; vve muſt diſcouer your fraudulent conveiances firſt; good Sir doe not abuſe vs in our tenets, and thereby abuſe your auditory al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; vve vſe not to ſpeake ſo promiſcuouſly, ſo generally, and ſo indiſtinctly, as you report vs: for, vve vſe not to ſay, one day in ſeauen, muſt be a Sabbath day: but thus, the <hi>laſt day of ſeauen,</hi> muſt be a Sabbath day; let this be noted: and this vve doe, to avoide the <hi>amphibolie,</hi> or double meaning of the phraſe which you charge vpon vs: for theſe vvords, <hi>one day in ſeauen,</hi> may
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:21140:119"/>haue a double meaning; either they may be vnderſtood gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, for any one day in the ſeauen, as vvell this as that; as wel the firſt of ſeauen, as the laſt of ſeauen, or any other of the ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: or, they may be vnderſtood, for ſome one certaine particular day, as the 7th day, &amp; laſt day of the ſeauen. Now vve, to auoid all doubling &amp; equiuocationes, doe addict our ſelues vnto the ſimplicity of ſpeech, &amp; therfore doe chooſe to ſay, the laſt day of ſeauen: rather then one of ſeauen: but Mr. Chappell quite contrary, he delights to vſe in publike, and to put vpon vs, ſuch phraſes, as haue a double meaning, that ſo he may the better double before his people, and delude them; novv of the two ſenſes propounded, (if vve ſhall vſe his phraſe) vve doe chooſe the latter, &amp; doe vnderſtand, by one day of ſeauen: that one day, which is the laſt day of ſeauen: but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Chappell doth chooſe the former ſenſe, vnderſtanding, by one day in ſeauen: any one day of the ſeauen indefinitly; this or that, or any other: Now in this ſenſe, his Minor is moſt falſe; neither ſhall he euer be able to proue it out of the 4th Com. that there is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, any one day of the ſeauen: for there is onely commanded that one day onely, which is the laſt of the ſeauen: furthermore, he hath abuſed both vs, but thats not much, but his honeſt audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory alſo, &amp; thats worſe, in alleaging of our Teſtimony in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as if vve did vphould &amp; iuſtify his falſe Minor; which we doe vtterly renownce, neuer vſeing his phraſe, in his ſenſe: the man is liuing of whom I ſpeake, if he thinke I vvrong him, he can right himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I come to the other part of his Minor, to wit, <hi>And not the 7th day:</hi> where he affirmeth, that the 7th day, is not the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day: for proofe hereof, he referred his auditory at that time, to what he had in former ſermons deliuered: my ſelfe not being preſent at his former ſermons, as I was at this, and being vnſatisfied with this reference, I went vnto him after his ſermon was ended, and deſired him to giue me a coppye or notes, of what he had formerly preacht againſt the Lords Sabbaths; and he asked me to what end I deſired his notes: my anſwer to him was thus, <hi>I promiſe you, that I will either confirme them, or confute them.</hi> I gaue him alſo certaine reaſons, to induce him to giue me
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:21140:119"/>his notes, as this, that he was the Lords Champion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who but hee ſhould defend the Lords cauſe? I told him further, that hee in ſpeciall ſorte, aboue all Miniſters had ingag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe in this quarrell, in as much as he had openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt my booke, &amp; the Lords Sabbaths therein defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and howbeit I did not raſhly, and of mine owne head goe vnto him vvith this requeſt (as I told him) but with the aduiſe of ſome <hi>Miniſter</hi> &amp; neere friend of his, who thought hee neither would, nor could deny me this requeſt, yet ſay vvhat I could, I could get no notes of him: ſo then for the latter part of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and the proofe of it, I muſt take it vpon his bare word, that he had formerly confuted the Lords Sabbaths: but whither he had or he had not, I can ſay nothing, becauſe I cannot obtaine a ſight of his notes; but I know what I thinke of it.</p>
                     <p>This one thing I remember, that M. Chappell was highly magnified &amp; applauded, not onely by his pariſhoners, but alſo by all Puritane Diuines that heard him, for his ſolid &amp; learned ouerthrowing of the Lords Sabbath: the which let vs take for granted, and ſo you ſhall ſee how the crafty, are caught in their owne craftineſſe: from this impiouſe &amp; vngodly doctrine of M. Chappell, thus I argue; If that the old Sabbath, mentioned in the morall law, be aboliſhed by M. Chappell, &amp; then hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proue infallibly, that we haue any new Sabbath <hi>jure diuino;</hi> then muſt M. Chappell, &amp; his pariſhoners, &amp; thoſe Puritane Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines that ſo applauded his doctrine, all turne <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> forthwith: and ſo keepe no Sabbath at all. The reaſon hereof is plaine; for if we haue neither the old Sabbath, nor any new Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, then we haue no Sabbath at all; and ſo muſt become Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes.</p>
                     <p>Hauing anſwered their arguments, whereby they would proue the Lords day, a Sabbath by the 4th com. I deſire the Reader but to looke backe vpon them, they are but 3 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; &amp; to conſider how poore &amp; feeble they are, and withall to thinke with what face they can ſo bouldly vrge the 4th com. in the pulpit, vpon the Lords day: and ſo I come to diſproue them, and to ſhew, that the 4th com. cannot be vrged vpon the Lords day; and let it be conſidered, whither their reaſons for it,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:21140:120"/>or mine againſt it, be the more cleere, and haue better force of prouing.</p>
                     <p>My firſt reaſon to the contrary, is that the Lords day cannot be a Sabbath day, by the 4th com. becauſe the 4th comman. doth command vs to worke on the Lords day: for, the 4th com. ſaith, <hi>Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour, and doe all thy worke,</hi> Exod. 20.9. and the firſt of theſe 6 dayes, is the day called the Lords day, as vve haue proued, in the expoſition of the 4th com. Now this law, inioyning vs to labour ſixe dayes, &amp; conſequently on the Lords day, was neuer repealed, for it was noe Type or ſhaddow of Chriſt &amp;c. Nay Chriſt ratified this law, by his owne practiſe; for he laboured and trauailed vp &amp; downe, too and fro, on this Lords day, after his reſurrection, Luk. 24.15. Now can any wiſe man thinke, that this 4th com. ſhould command vs to Reſt from worke, on the Lords day, when the ſame comm. comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to worke on the Lords day? behold whither theſe men are not fit expounders of Scripture, when they are ſo ignorant therein, as they make not onely one Scripture contradict an other Scripture, but, then the which is nothing more abſurd, they make one and the ſame Scripture to contradict it ſelfe? for they make the 4th com. to ſay, Thou ſhalt not worke on the Lords day; when it ſaith the quite contrary, Sixe dayes thou ſhalt worke, of which 6 the Lords day is one: may not I truely ſay of theſe Miniſters, who thus abuſe Gods law in expounding it, as Paul ſaid of ſome, that <hi>they would be Doctours of the law, and yet vnderstand not what they ſpeake, neither whereof they affirme?</hi> 1. Tim. 1.7,</p>
                     <p>My ſecond argument againſt them is this; That Sabbath day, which is commanded in the 4th com. it is a weekly Sabbath, on euery 7th day. But it cannot be proued, that the Lords day, is a weekly Sabbath; for in Chriſts time, and in the Apoſtles times, it vvas not kept conſtantly, and vveekly, but once in a yeere, or the like as hath bene ſhowne. Therefore, the Lords day, is not, nor can be commanded, in the 4th com.</p>
                     <p>My third argument to the contrary, is becauſe the time, the circumſtance of time, as they cale it, in the 4th Comm. is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, as themſelues ſay &amp; teach: for, they teach that by theſe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:21140:120"/>Textes of Scripture, Rom. 14.5. Gal. 4.10. and Coloſ. 2.16.17. the time of the 7th day, comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the 4th com. is a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, &amp; a Ievvſh ceremony, &amp;c. Now from their owne doctrine I argue againſt them thus; If the commaunded time, in the 4th Com. be a circumſtance, and a Iewiſh ceremony, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; then very fooliſhly doe they that vvill rune to the 4th Com. for time, for the new Sabbath, or Lords day: aske them by what precept this time of the Lords day, is to be <hi>ſanctified,</hi> &amp; they vvill tell you by the 4th com. ſo that they will fetch a time out of the 4th Comm. and yet they ſay this time is aboliſhed, what contradicting folly is this? wherefore vnleſſe they can proue, that there vvas two dayes, and two times, the 7th day, and the 8th day, commanded in the 4th com. their doeings are like vnto a fooliſh gardiner, vvho hauing but one bed of time in his garden, firſt he vvill cut it, or roote it all vp, and then he will make all men beleeue, that yet for all that, he can fetch as much time out of that bed, as he could doe before it was rooted vp: of ſuch pulpit gardiners vve haue too many: they can take out of the Com. what they pleaſe; &amp; they can put into it againe, what they pleaſe; But the greateſt riddle is behind, hovv can a man take a thing away, and yet leaue it there ſtill? or, how can a man ſay a thing is ceremoniall, &amp; yet make it Morall? aboliſhed by Chriſt, &amp; yet remaine after Chriſt, many hundreth yeeres? none but theſe men, can anſwer this riddle. Wherefore, ſince the time in the 4th Com. is aboliſhed as themſelues ſay, there is no time therefore left in the 4th Commandement for the Lords day.</p>
                     <p>My 4th argument againſt them is, becauſe the 4th Com. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree to the Lords day: for 1. the day commanded in the 4th Com. is a day called properlie the Sabbath day, Remember the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> Exod. 20.8. But this day vvhich they vvould haue is called <hi>Lords day,</hi> ſo that they differ palpablie in their names. 2. The day commanded in the 4th Com. it is the 7th day; <hi>But the 7th day is the Sabbath of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Exod. 20.10. but the day vvhich they talke on, it is the 8th day, or the firſt day of the vveeke: novv is there not difference enough to be ſene, betwixt the 7th &amp; the 8th? Betwixt the firſt, &amp; the laſt? the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:21140:121"/>one day is at the begining of the weeke, the other is at the ending of the weeke. 3. The day commanded in the 4th Com. it is that day vvhich God bleſſed &amp; ſanctified, Geneſ. 2.3. and it is that day, vvhereon God himſelfe reſted: but the Lords day, which they vvould haue, it is not that day which God bleſſed and ſanctified, nor that day wheron God reſted. 4. The day vvhich is commanded in the 4th Com. it is that day, vnto which the ſpeciall reaſon, annexed by God, to the 4th Com. Exod. 20.11. doth properly belong: but the Lords day, vvhich they would haue ſtand by the 4th Comm. vnto it that ſpeciall reaſon neither doth belong, nor can poſſiblie be made to belong. 5. The day inioyned in the 4th Com. was a day knowne by thoſe Iewes, &amp; in vſe before the giuing of the Law on Mount Sinay, as the word <hi>Remember</hi> at the begining of the 4th Com. import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: for vve remember things knowne before, &amp;c. But the Lords day I truſt is not of ſuch antiquity, nor was it knowne or in vſe before the giuing of the Law: and therfore the Lords day was not commanded in the 4th Com.</p>
                     <p>Herevnto I might yet add an other difference, that the day commanded by the 4th Comm. it is a day to be kept in memory of the Creation; But the day which they would haue, the Lords day, it is to be kept, in memory of the Redemption: and is it not a likly matter, thinke you, that both theſe dayes, differing as farr as the Creation doth from the Redemption, ſhould be commaunded by one and the ſame Com. vnleſſe men vvould ſtuddy hovv to bewray their folly, I cannot deuiſe hovv they ſhould doe it more groſely: if this be not botching &amp; cobling, to thruſt this nevv Sabbath day, into an old Commandement, I know not vvhat is: to coble, is to put a peece of new leather vnto an old ſhoe; and to botch, is to put a peece of nevv cloth, vpon an old garment, vvhen that which was there before, is growne old and worne out; iuſt ſo they deale in theſe Diuine things, the 7th day Sabbath being old and vvorne out (as they ſay) they haue novv vvith all their skill, vvrought into the Com. a nevv peece, to vvit, the Lords day; ſuch a peece of Taylery vvas neuer ſeene before. Should Popiſh Ieſuites thus abuſe the Scriptures, in point of difference betvvixt them &amp; vs,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:21140:121"/>as vvorſe I thinke they doe not, nor cannot, hovv vvould euen theſe very Miniſters, make them a ſcorne &amp; a reproch, &amp; iuſtly, among the people? But if wee doe it among our ſelues, no man muſt ſpeake of it; but let my tounge cleaue to the roote of my mouth, if I be ſilent, vvhen Gods Lawes are thus mangled; and his holy &amp; ſacred word, corrupted &amp; abuſed; and all to this end, to maintaine ſuperſtition, in keeping a nevv invented Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee vve haue diſpoſſeſſed them of their ſtrongeſt hould for their Lords day Sabbath, to vvit, the 4th Com. let vs in the next place make ſome vſe of this point: Is it ſo, that they cannot proue by their 3 arguments that the Lords day, is a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, by virtue of the 4th Comm. and is it ſo, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is proued, to vvit, that the 4th Com. cannot be applied to the Lords day, as binding mens conſciences vnto it; then let Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters take heede hovv they abuſe the 4th com. in their pulpits, hereafter, by applying it vnto the Lords day falſly; for they muſt giue an accompt to God one day, for their <hi>diuiding</hi> and <hi>applying</hi> Gods word, and if they make the Spirit of God to ſpeake vvhat hee neuer meant, it vvill be <hi>woe</hi> vnto them: thats one point.</p>
                     <p>An other is this, that it behoueth Miniſters to haue a care, ſo truly and plainly to interpret the 4th Com. to the people, that when they reade the Com. they may vnderſtand vvhich day of the weeke it is, which God inioyneth for his Sabbath day: you know, on Sundaies, the 10 Commandements are publikly &amp; ſolemnly reade vnto the people, with greate deuotion, as it is meete they ſhould be: and alſo at the ſolemne adminiſtration of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, then theſe 10 commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are reade vnto the people againr; novv it is the duety of euery Miniſter, vvhen hee ſtandeth in the roome of God, in pronouncing of the Law vnto the people, that he doe not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, ſaying one thing and meaning an other; vvherefore vvhen he ſaith <hi>Remember the Sabbath day,</hi> he muſt not deſire in his heart, that the people ſhould vnderſtand him of an other day, that is not the Sabbath day, but of the <hi>Lords day;</hi> for this is to ſay one thing and meane an other; which is a ſinne in all men,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:21140:122"/>but a double ſinne in a Miniſter; againe, vvhen he pronounceth theſe vvords, with an audible voice, <hi>But the 7th day, is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</hi> he muſt not deſire in his minde, that the people ſhould vnderſtand him of a day that is not the 7th day, but of the 8th day, the day after the 7th day; for this is diſſimulation: now for a man to diſſemble at any time is a ſinne, but vvhen the Miniſter is in Gods vvorſhip &amp; ſeruice, yea at the bleſſed Sacrament, ready to eate the body &amp; drinke the blood of our bleſſed Sauiour, then to diſſemble, is a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſe ſinne. For a Miniſter to diſſemble vvith one man, is an euill; but for him to diſſemble vvith an vvhole Congregation this is a foule euill: but thus to doe, vvhen he repreſenteth the perſon of God vnto the people, &amp; ſtands in his roome vvho is the God of Trueth, novv to diſſemble, it is the fouleſt euill of all.</p>
                     <p>What a ſtraung thing is it, that Miniſters ſhould in Gods roome, ſay vnto the people, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day, to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy it:</hi> and yet will not indure it, that their people ſhould Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Sabbath day; but they vvill call it Iudaiſme, if they ſanctifie it? or, they will haue one tricke or other, one diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or other, to caſt in their way, whereby they will hinder them from ſanctifying it? They call vpon the people to keepe Gods 4th Com. and pray in &amp; vvith the Congregation, to keepe this <hi>Law,</hi> the 4th Com. &amp; yet they vvill not abide it, that their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould doe the things commanded, in this commandement? one of the things commanded in this 4th com. is that we ſhould ſanctify the 7th day; but this they will none of: vvhat an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible kind of diſſembling is this to call much, frequently &amp; zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, vpon the people, to kepe this <hi>Law</hi> of God; and yet vvill not abide, that their people ſhould doe &amp; performe, the things <hi>commanded,</hi> in this <hi>Law?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let me alſo ſpeake a word or two, vnto the people; and firſt as touching their deuotions in the Congregation; you heare the Miniſter reade thus, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day &amp;c. But the 7th day is the Sabbath &amp;c.</hi> vnto the which you deuoutly add this prayer, <hi>Lord haue mercy vpon vs, and incline our hearts to keepe this Law;</hi> By which prayer, you doe yeeld your aſſent vnto what the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:21140:122"/>Miniſter had vttered: it is your dueties now alſo to ſee to it, that you know what you pray; elſe, as the Miniſter ſaith one thing, and meaneth an other, ſo the people ſay they know not what: you are loath to ſubſcribe your name vnto a writing, or put your ſeale vnto a bond, vntill you haue read it ouer, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand vvell vvhat it is, that you put your hand or ſeale vnto: Why this your prayer, after the Miniſter hath recited Gods 4th com. is as your handwriting, or ſeale put vnto Gods com. you muſt therefore vnderſtand vvell vvhat you ſeale vnto: When the Miniſter ſaith, Remember the <hi>Sabbath day:</hi> vvill you pray God, to haue mercy on you, &amp; incline your heart to keepe the <hi>Lords day?</hi> and vvhen the Miniſter ſaith, But the 7th day, is the Sabbath: Will you deſire God, to incline your heart, to keepe the 8th day for the Sabbath? I pray iudge in your ſelues, vvhat this is better then babling before God; vve muſt pray vvith the ſpirit, and vve muſt pray vvith our vnderſtanding alſo: and that eſpecially vvhen vve are redy to partake of the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let me ſpeake vnto the people, as touching their keeping of this Lords day, in conſcience of this 4th com. you ſee they cannot bring any proueing arguments, to euince it, that the 4th. com. belongeth vnto the Lords day: beſides, you ſee I haue proued the contrary, that the 4th com. cannot belong vnto the Lords day; vvherefore, people may be as zealouſe as they will, in ſanctifying of the Lords day; and hope to pleaſe God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as a duety of the 4th com. but let them beleeue it, all this their zeale, is as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, a zeale without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Rom. 10.2. All this their religion, is but meere ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they thinke to pleaſe God hereby, but God may ſay vnto them, who required this at your hands? may not this truely be counted, as a limme of that <hi>voluntarie religion,</hi> and, <hi>will worſhip,</hi> condemned by S.

The like I might ſpeake to all other Tradſmen, in Citties &amp; Townes.</p>
                     <p>I haue often heard many ſcruples &amp; queſtions moued, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the religiouſe keeping of the Sabbath day, meaning it of our Lords day: as whither it be lawfull for Taylers to carry home &amp; fit new garments on the Sabbath day morning: and whither Shoemakers, may fit ſhoes in the morning &amp;c. and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Water-men, may row on the Sabbath day, after Euening prayer: and whither Marriners, may ſet ſayle, &amp; begine a voyage on the Sabbath day: and whither any May-games, ſhooting, and bowleing, or like recreations be lawfull on our Sabbath day: and I haue heard it much queſtioned, vvhen the Sabbath day doth begine &amp; end; at morning, at midnight, or on the Euening; and the like.</p>
                     <p>To theſe &amp; the like queſtiones I anſwer, 1. if the lawes of the Realme will permit theſe on the Lords day, I anſwer the law of Gods 4th com. is not againſt them; but rather with them, ſaying, Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour &amp;c. whereof the Lords day is one. 2. I anſwer, it is mens duty, firſt of all, to be inquiſitive after the day it ſelfe, to know which day is the Sabbath day, before they inquire how the day ſhould be ſpent, &amp; what may be done on the day, and what not; there is a greater errour amongſt vs, then they are aware on; their ſcruples &amp; queſtiones, are like vnto the <hi>minte,</hi> &amp; <hi>anniſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>cummin;</hi> but there is an other thing a <hi>weightier</hi> matter of the law neglected, &amp; to be queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: &amp; that is to know, whither the 7th day, or the 8th day, be the Sabbath day, or to know whither we keepe the Lords Sabbath at all, or not: for I confidently auowch it, that Gods Sabbaths commanded in his morall law, are wholly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:21140:123"/>&amp; profaned.

                     <p>A ſecond text produced to proue the Lords day, a Sabbath day, is Pſal. 118.24. <hi>This is the day, which the Lord hath made; let vs reioyce &amp; be glad in it.</hi> Here ſay ſome, the word <hi>made</hi> may be tranſlated <hi>Sanctified;</hi> &amp; further, this day here ſpoken of, was a type of the very day of Chriſts reſurrection, on the Lords day, or firſt day of the weeke: &amp; therfore God made or Sanctified this day for a Sabbath. Before I anſwer this text, leaſt ſome ſhould obiect vnto me, that I debaſe their cauſe, by bringing in ſuch weake textes, as no man of note will make vſe of this way; for to this purpoſe, one <hi>M. Pottes,</hi> an auncient diuine, beiond the Seaes, obiected this very text vnto me, as finding fault with me, for putting it into my former booke, ſo lightly hee eſteemd it. now to wipe away ſuch preiudiciall thoughts, let it be knowne, I could inſtance Authoures in printed bookes, who doe vrge it; but ſparing them, I will nominate one of my 10 aduerſaries ſtanding vpon this text ſtifly, and it is <hi>M. Gallard,</hi> Miniſter of Sprowſton in Norff: ſometyme pupill to the foreſaid <hi>M. Pottes,</hi> and ſo I come to the anſwer.</p>
                     <p>My 1. anſwer to this Text is, that vvhereas M. Gallard ſaith, the vvord made, may be tranſlated ſanctified. I anſwer him, that ſo the vvord may be tranſlated <hi>made</hi> alſo; and that to tranſlate it made, is the more fitting in this place, all our <hi>Tranſlators</hi> both old and nevv, doe beare me vvitneſſe; for they all render it <hi>made:</hi> Novv if it may be tranſlated made; how vvill he proue, that it muſt be tranſlated ſanctified? for hee muſt remember, that it is his part to proue, that the vvord muſt neceſſarily be tranſlated Sanctified. Happily he vvill ſay, that the vvord ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to ſanctifye, vvhen it is referred to dayes &amp;c. but, ſo the vvord vſually ſignifieth alſo, vvhen it is referred vnto men, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:21140:124"/>yet in one place it ſignifieth <hi>appointed</hi> or <hi>ordeined,</hi> thus the <hi>Medes</hi> &amp; <hi>Perſians</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified</hi> of God, Iſa. 13.3.17. That is, appointed of God to execute his iudgements; &amp; vvhy may not the vvord then be once ſo meant alſo, vvhen it is referred to dayes?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſvver him, ſuppoſe it muſt be tranſlated <hi>ſanctified,</hi> then I diſtinguiſh of Sanctification of dayes; ſome dayes are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for Sabbaths, for the Church to Reſt on; other ſome dayes are ſanctified for other endes, as for ſome particular mans vſe in the Church, as here in this text Pſ. 118.24. This day which the Lord made or ſanctified, he made it or ſanctified it, for Dauids vſe properly, for the day wherin he ſhould come to the Crowne; and ſo typically for Chtiſt his vſe, and for the day wherein he ſhould be honourablie raiſed from the dead, the Lords day; now this Pſalme is to be vnderſtood in this latter ſenſe, as he that hath but halfe an eye may ſee; how then vvill he proue, that this Lords day, whereon Chriſt roſe, was ſanctified for the Church to ſanctifie, vvhen it vvas ſanctified for Chriſt alone to riſe in? for this day, vvas not ſanctified for the vvhole Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but for Chriſt alone: not for the Church to reſt on, but for Chriſt to riſe on.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I anſwer by an other diſtinction, the word <hi>Day</hi> is ſome time taken in Scripture for a ſhorte &amp; ordenary day of 12. howres or the like; and ſometime it is taken for a long ſpace of time, conteining many dayes, vveekes, moneths, or yeeres, as Ioh. 8.56. Abraham reioyced to ſee <hi>my day</hi> &amp;c. and 2. Cor. 6.2. behold now the <hi>day of ſaluation.</hi> Now the word Day in Pſa. 118.24. may be taken in this latter ſenſe, for all that time vvherein Dauid raigned, and ſo for all that time of Chriſt vpon the earth after his reſurrection; or longer, wherein he raigneth in his Church as King; how then vvill <hi>M. Gallard</hi> doe to proue, that by day here, muſt be meant a ſhorte &amp; ordenary day of 12 or more howres, or a weekly Sabbath day?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I anſwer, ſay the vvord day be to be taken for a ſhort day, then let it be proued, that this is a prophecy of a weekly day, as of euery Sunday or Lords day: for it may be a prophecy of a yeerly day onely, as of <hi>Easter</hi> day, ſince on that day Chriſt roſe
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:21140:124"/>from the dead: and if it be no otherwiſe, how will they doe for a weekly Sabbath, on euery Lords day?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I anſwer, that this Pſalme cannot be a prophecy, that the Lords day, or day wherein Chriſt was to riſe, ſhould be a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; and that I proue, becauſe Chriſt kept not this Lords day, or day of his reſurrection, vvhen it came, as a Sabbath day, but as a vvorking day; for hee trauailed vp and downe, too and fro, on that day; and ſo did his Diſciples; yea the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues were ignorant, that this firſt Lords day, ſhould be a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: for they beleeued not, that Chriſt was riſen, but ſorrowed &amp; vvept, all the day long vntill it vvas nere night; and ſo could not kepe it a Sabbath in memory of the reſurrection: Theſe things haue bene proued alredy: Novv had this Pſalme bene a prophecy that the firſt Lords day, vvhereon Chriſt roſe, ſhould haue bene a Sabbath day, Chriſt muſt haue kept this day, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvith his Diſciples, as a Sabbath day: becauſe Chriſt muſt fulfill all things prophecied of him. And thus much for anſvver to this abuſed text of Scripture.</p>

I anſwer, it is not to be ſuppoſed, but it muſt be proued by them; that this Pentecoſt day, vvhereon Peter preached, vvas that yeere vpon the Lords day, or Sunday: for it is houlden by many, that Pentecoſt day, doth follow according to the day of the Moneth variably, and not according to the day of the vveeke conſtantly: <hi>Waleus</hi> vpon the 4th Com. Pag. 161. ſaith <hi>it is caled into queſtion of ſome whither this Pentecoſt day, fell then vpon the Lords day or not.</hi> Yea, he addeth that <hi>Pentecoſt may fale on any day of the weeke.</hi> To this agreeth <hi>Aynſworth</hi> on Leuit. 23.11.15. alleaging it to be the opinion of Sondry <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines;</hi> and according to the Hebrew <hi>Canones;</hi> and tranſlations of the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> &amp; <hi>Septuagint;</hi> that Pentecoſt followeth the day of moneth, and ſo is variable, being one yeere vpon one day of the weeke, &amp; an other yeere vpon an other day of the vveeke: and herevnto alſo doe beare witneſſe, the <hi>Iewes</hi> whereſoeuer novv liuing; for they keepe their Feaſt of Pentecoſt by the accounte of the Moone; and one yeere vpon one day of the weeke, and the next yeere vpon an other. Wherefore ſince it is the moſt likely that Pentecoſt day then fell vpon ſome other day of the weeke, as Saturday, or the like, hovv vvill they proue it fell novv vvhen Peter preached, on the Lords day, or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I anſwer, but ſuppoſe we that it was the Lords day, wherin all this vvas done, it yet doth not follow, that this day was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Sabbath day; for theſe actions, were no proper actions of a Sabbath day, &amp; done onely vpon Sabbath dayes; for they were common weeke dayes actions &amp; ſuch as might be, may be, and were done vpon any day of the weeke: let vs rune thorough the particulars briefly; and firſt for the Holy Ghoſtes deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; how will they make it appeare, that the Holy Ghoſt in his diſcent doth vvaite for a Sabbath day, to come downe in? vve reade of the Holy Ghoſts deſcending, in Act. 10.44. and in Act. 19.6. But not a vvord, that theſe dayes were Sabbath dayes. If notable actions done in a day, muſt ſanctify that day for a Sabbath day, vvhy are not good Friday, wherin Chriſt ſuffered, &amp; Hallow Thurſday, vvherin Chriſt aſcended, made Sabbaths alſo? for theſe workes, vvere as behoofefull for the Church, as
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:21140:125"/>was the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt. 2. For the Sacrament of Baptiſme, the adminiſtration of this, is no proper worke for a Sabbath, but may be done in any common day: Elſe why doe vvee baptiſe children, on any day of the vveeke? and vvhy did <hi>Phillip</hi> Baptiſe the Eunuch on a trauailing day? Act. 8.38.39. Paul baptized <hi>Lydia</hi> &amp; hir houſhold, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Saturday Sabbath Act. 16.15. Sacraments were neuer appropriated to the Sabbath day, as vve may ſee in Circumciſion, it vvas on the 8 day, were it Sabbath day or not: the Paſſeouer, it was on the 14th day of the moneth, were it Sabbath day or not: &amp; Chriſt did eate the Lords Supper, on Thurſday night, the night before he was crucified. 3. For Peters ſermon: we know preaching is no worke ſo proper vnto the Sabbath day, as it may not be on any day of the weeke alſo: elſe, why preach wee on Lecture dayes, on any of the weeke dayes? preaching may be on any day of the weeke, according to that 2. Tim. 4.2. <hi>preach the word, be inſtant, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon.</hi> Chriſt preached on a vvorking day, to the Samaritan vvoman; his Diſciples being gone into the Citty to buy meate Ioh. 4.8. the Apoſtles preached <hi>daily</hi> in the Temple, and from houſe to houſe, Act. 5.42. thus it appeareth that theſe are ſuch actions, as may be done on any day of the weeke, &amp; hovv then will it follow, that this day of Pentecoſt was Sabbath day, becauſe theſe actions vvere done in that day? theſe are farr from neceſſary conſequences I am ſuer. No maruaile they pretend neceſſary conſequences for the Lords day; and magnify their reaſon ſo highly, in the want of a Commandement for the day: I ſee novv, ther is ſome cauſe indeede, that they ſhould ſet a good face vpon the matter, and hauing no Com. from Chriſt for the day, yet they ſhould make the world beleeue, that they haue good conſequences for the purpoſe; and doe you not ſee how good they are? had they neither conſequence, nor Com. for the day, they ſhould haue iuſt nothing for it; they had need therefore extoll their neceſſary conſequences.</p>
                     <p>Doe not vve on a Chriſtmas day, vvhen it falleth on a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, or weeke day; both pray, &amp; preach, &amp; vſe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and reſt from laboures, and ſing Pſalmes, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; and vvill any wiſe man ſay, thers neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in it, that we keepe it for a Sabbath day? what vanities are theſe?</p>

                     <p>The vtmoſt that can be collected by good conſequence, from this Text, Act. 2. is that the Church kept this day of Pentecoſt for a <hi>Lecture</hi> day; like as vve haue Lecture dayes euery vvhere on vveeke dayes, on Tewſdayes, or Thurſdayes, &amp; the like.</p>
                     <p>Further it is to be noted that Peters Sermon heere, it vvas meerly occationall, &amp; <hi>extraordenary,</hi> &amp; therfore can not binde vs to <hi>ordenary</hi> practiſe.

                     <p>Further, vve may aſwell coliect hence alſo concerning the place, as the time; ſaying, that vve muſt euermore preach in a populouſe and famouſe Citty alſo, as <hi>London, Norwich,</hi> and the like; for Peter preached in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> a famouſe Citty.

                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:21140:127"/> 4. My 4th &amp; laſt anſwer to this text is, by ſhewing their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd conſequence hence: for, if that the coming downe of the holy Ghoſt, &amp; Peters ſermon, &amp; the convertion of 3000. &amp; the baptizing of them, &amp;c. did declare the day to be a Sabbath day, wherein they were done; then is <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> a Iewiſh ceremoniall feaſt day, moralized, &amp; made a Chriſtian Sabbath day: and ſo Iewiſh abrogated ceremonies, ſhall be reuiued in the Church: the reaſon thereof is, becauſe the holy Ghoſt doth not call this day here, Lords day, or firſt day of the weeke; but he calleth it Pentecoſt day; <hi>and when the day of Pentecoſt was come,</hi> Act. 2.1. This day, might be called by <hi>3</hi> ſeuerall names, as <hi>1.</hi> Lords day. 2. The firſt day of the weeke: and 3. Pentecoſt day. Now in that the holy Ghoſt, reiecteth both thoſe names, of Lords day, and firſt day of the weeke, which ſhould make for their purpoſe; &amp; chooſeth this name Pentecoſt day, which was a ceremoniall day, it followeth, that if theſe actions, had any force or virtue to declare the day whereon they were done, to be a Sabbath day, they ſhewed vs, that this day conſidered not as Lords day, but as Pentecoſt day, is our new Sabbath day. Suppoſe we, that vpon a Friday, there fall ij holy dayes, the one <hi>Gowries day,</hi> the other King <hi>Charles</hi> his Coronation day: here this one day, may haue 3 names, as Friday, Gowries day, and the Kings Coronation day: if now an Acte of Parliament be made, hauing relation to this day, and calleth it Coronation day, rather then by thoſe other ij names: vvill not euery one thinke that that Acte hath rather reference to this day, conſidered as King Charles his Coronation day, then to it conſidered as Friday, or as Gowries day? ſo tis here, no man can thinke, but that the holy Ghoſt, in relation of theſe things done on this day, and naming it Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt day &amp; not Lords day, had rather reference vnto it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as Pentecoſt day, to make it a <hi>Pentecost Sabbath,</hi> then to it as Lords day, to make it a <hi>Lords day Sabbath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, I make it appeare, that if we imitate Peter here, and the Church at Ieruſalem, vve muſt keepe the Lords day, as a ceremoniall day, &amp; as Pentecoſt day; for they all kept it ſo, as Ieruſalem, Act. 2.1. and this I thus proue; 1. It is graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all that the Ceremonies of the lavv, had 40 or 50 yeeres,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:21140:128"/>vntill the deſtruction of the Temple, allovved for their honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable buriall: Whereby is intimated, that vntill then the Legall Ceremonies vvere in vſe at Ieruſalem. 2. It is cleere by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſee Act. 21.20.17. vvhere the Apoſtles teld Paul, that all the belecuing Iewes, vvere ſtill <hi>zealouſe of the Law:</hi> Yea further, the Apoſtles perſwaded Paul, that novv he being come to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, that hee vvould Iudaize alſo, by <hi>purifying</hi> himſelfe, &amp; <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing</hi> &amp;c. v. 24. and all vvas done to this end, that the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing lewes, might thinke nothing to the contrary, but that Paul himſelfe alſo <hi>kept the law;</hi> to vvit, the Ceremoniall Lavv: by vvhich paſſages, it is more then manifeſt that at Ieruſalem, the Apoſtles, and all the beleeuing Jevves, they ſtill obſerued the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall lavv, and that zealouſly; novv this vvas all long after Pentecoſt day; ſo that, if they kept the ceremoniall lavv, ſo long after Chriſt, much more then at Pentecoſt, vvhich vvas vvithin 6 or 7 vveekes after his reſurrection: Wherefore, vve are to thinke that theſe Iewes, at Jeruſalem, kept Pentecoſt, as a Iewiſh ceremoniall Sabbath day; vvhereof you may reade Leu. 23.15.21. and ſo by conſequence it follovveth, that if theſe vvorkes of the holy Ghoſts deſcending, and of Peters preaching, &amp;c. doe declare this Lords day, to be a Sabbath day; that then vve muſt haue a Pentecoſt Sabbath day, rather then a Lords Sabbath day; a ceremoniall Sabbath day, not a Chriſtian Sabbath day; and the Lords day, is not to be kept as Lords day, but as Pentecoſt day. Behold then the abſurdety, of theſe men, who glorie ſo much in this text, Act. 2.1. as being ſo ſtrong for their new Sabbath day, when as they may by the ſame reaſon, bring into the Church againe, this ceremoniall abrogated day of Pentecoſt: behold how vnconſcionably they deale vvith the Scriptures, and vvord of God, making them a noſe of vvaxe; turning it vvhich vvay they pleaſe as may beſt fit their fancies: if any conſcience be left in them, they had need (I auowch it) aſke God mercy vpon their knees, for ſuch abuſes offred vnto his ſacred vvord.</p>
                     <p>For concluſion, let the patrones of this Lords day Sabbath remember, that this is their taske, if they will proue the Lords day a Sabbath. 1. They muſt proue, that this Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from labour all this day; and that in conſcience of it as a

                     <p>A 3d texte they alleage &amp; abuſe, in the nevv Teſtament, is Act. 20.7. vvhere they ſay is an example of the Lords day kept as a Sabbath day, by Paul, &amp; the Church at Troas: for, Paul abode at Troas 7 dayes, &amp; on the 7th day, it being the firſt day of the vveeke, then the Church aſſembled, &amp; Paul preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; now thers no mention of any ſermon vpon any of the other dayes, and therefore this vvas their Sabbath day. Yea, they had not onely a ſermon on this day, but alſo the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, for the Diſciples came together to <hi>breake bread,</hi> as the Text ſaith: Wherefore this day muſt be a Sabbath day: This text <hi>M. Benton</hi> Miniſter, preſſed vpon me very eagerly.</p>
                     <p>Herevnto I anſwer 1. if the Lords day, or firſt day of the weeke, vvere kept here by Paul for a Sabbath day, why did not Paul doe the like vpon euery Lords day, in all Churches where he came? and where he might if he vvould, haue done it? for this purpoſe ſee Act. 13.14.42.44. where mention is made, how Paul vvent into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, to vvit, the 7th day Sabbath, at Antiochia, and there preached: Now ſermon being ended, the text ſaith, that <hi>the Gentiles beſought that they would preach theſe words to them, the next Sabbath day,</hi> &amp; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it vvas ſo done v. 44. Now it is to be noted, that theſe Gentiles vvere conuerted beleeuers, as the text bewraieth v. 42.43. and it is to be noted alſo, that this day being Saturday, on which they thus deſired Paul &amp; Barnabas to preach vnto them theſe words the next Sabbath day, that the next day after their petition, being Sunday, or Lords day, this was the Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, if any ſuch they had; and this was the proper Sabbath day, for theſe beleeuing Gentiles, if any ſuch there vvas: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 1. it ſeemeth that theſe beleeuing Gentiles vvere vtterly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of any ſuch new Sabbath; for elſe they vvould haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Paul &amp; Barnabas to haue preached vnto them, the next day, not the next Sabbath day; the next Lords day, not the next
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:21140:129"/>Sabbath day: for they being an hungry, &amp; finding a ſharpe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit to Pauls doctrine; vvould not haue faſted for it 7. or 8. dayes, vntill the next Sabbath day, but vvould rather haue bene fedde with it, on the next morrow, the day after, it being the Lords day, and appointed for ſermons, &amp; Sabbath day: but in as much as they deſired it not on the Lords day, it argueth that theſe Chriſtians knew not of any ſuch new Sabbath, as now vve know &amp; keepe on the Lords day. 2. Seeing it was the vviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Apoſtles, to acquaint the Churches vvith the new ordinances of Chriſt, vpon the firſt opportunity; as vve ſee they baptiſed thoſe that vvere but newly conuerted Act. 2.41. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to thinke, that if theſe beleeuing Gentiles, had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected their duetie, or had not formerly bene taught, that the Lords day vvas their new Sabbath, yet now Paul &amp; Barnabas, if the one forgat it, the other might minde it, they had a moſt fit opportunity to reueale to theſe beleeuing Gentiles, their new Sabbath day; they might haue taken a fit occation to haue anſwered their ſuite thus, vvhat, doe you deſire to heare the ſame doctrine againe, the next Sabbath day? Why you need not ſtay ſo long, thats 7 or 8 dayes hence, and thats Iudaiſme, &amp; the Iewiſh Sabbath day &amp;c. but to morrow, thats the Lords day, &amp; that is your Sabbath day; ſeeing you are Chriſtians, aſſemble your ſelues together therefore to morrow, and then you ſhall heare the ſame words preached againe: ſo the Apoſtles had ſit occation to haue informed theſe Diſciples at Antioch, of their new Sabbath, if there had beene any; nay I cannot ſee, how with diſcharge of their function they could haue omitted ſuch an occation.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, as I ſaid, the Apoſtles might haue kept this Lords day, heere, if they vvould; for nothing hindered; foraſmuch as theſe Gentiles, were ſuiters vnto the Apoſtles, to preach vnto them; it was at the Apoſtles liberty, to appoint the day and time vvhen; and the ſooner the rather: if therfore, here vvas fit opportunity; &amp; alſo, it was at the Apoſtles liberty, to appoint the Lords day to preach in, and to aſſemble the Church on that day, and yet for all this, did not appoint the Lords day, vvho can thinke that the Apoſtles, Paul and Barnabas eſteemed
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:21140:130"/>the Lords day, to be Sabbath day; and hereby it appeareth alſo, that Paul kept not this Lords day conſtantly, at all times, and in all places: which is an argument, that when Paul did preach, on the Lords day, as heere he did at Troas, Act. 20.7. that he kept it not for a Sabbath day; for then he vvould haue kept euery Lords day, where euer he came, as well as this one at Troas. And this is my firſt anſwer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſwer, whereas the Patrones of this new Sabbath take it for granted, that Pauls Sermon, and the Lords Supper, were actions performed on the Lords day, or firſt day of the weeke, this I deny them, &amp; this they muſt proue: for it vvill be found, that both the ſermon, and the Lords Supper, were done in the night time, which is no parte of the day; and conſequently that theſe actions were not done on the Lords day. I confeſſe the Diſciples mett on the Lords day, or firſt day of the weeke, but it followeth not thence, that therfore Paul preached, &amp; admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the Lords Supper, on this firſt day, vvherin they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: that this is no paradox, you ſhall ſee the Text giueth me light vnto this anſwer; as for Pauls Sermon, that this vvas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the night time, after the Lords day vvas paſt; ſee the Text, which ſaith, <hi>there were many lightes in an vpper chamber, where they were aſſembled,</hi> v. 8. Ergo, it was in the night time that they vvere aſſembled; againe, the Text ſaith, that <hi>Paul continued his preaching vnto midnight,</hi> v. 7. Wherefore it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that Pauls Sermon was in the night. Further as for the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, it vvas in thoſe dayes an euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or night vvorke, ſee Mark. 14.17.22. 1 Cor. 11.21. and Paul did not celebrate the Lords Supper, in all liklihood vntill midnight after his Sermon was finiſhed ſee Act. 20.11. ſo both the Sermon, and the Sacrament were performed in the night.</p>
                     <p>It is likly alſo, that the Diſciples here at Troas, aſſembled not in the morning, but in the latter end of the Lords day, about the ſhutting in of the day, for it is ſaid in the Text, that the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples came together to breake bread,</hi> v. 7. that is, to receiue the Lords Supper; now foraſmuch as the Lords Supper, was an Euening or night worke, in thoſe dayes, as hath bene proued, it is to be thought, that when the Diſciples mett to eate the Lords
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:21140:130"/>Supper, that they mett not in the morning, or at breakfaſt time, to eate their Supper, but at Supper time, and at Euening time, at the end of the day. Againe, the text ſaieth, <hi>Paul continued his preaching vntill midnight.</hi> Now it is a moſt vnreaſonable thing to imagine, that Paul ſhould begine his ſermon, in the morning, about 8 of the clocke, &amp; <hi>continue</hi> his preaching vntill midnight: it was neuer heard, that there ſhould be a ſermon made of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene howres long: vvherefore it is the moſt likely, that Paul might begine his ſermon after Supper, about 9 or 10 a clocke at night, &amp; ſo held on till midnight: There is no likely hood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Paul preached in the day time; much leſſe that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane in the morning; vnleſſe you vvill abſurdly imagine, that the Diſciples mett at Breakefaſt time to goe to ſupper: and alſo, that Paul preached a ſermon of 16. howres long; vvhich no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor could beare vvith patience &amp; proffit.</p>
                     <p>Neither will that hinder this, in that the text ſaith, that the Diſciples mett <hi>on the firſt day</hi> of the vveeke v. 7. for, as a man may be ſaid to pay a ſumme of mony on ſuch a day, though he paye it not till a quarter of an howre before Sune ſet; ſo may they be ſaid, to mete on the firſt day, albeit it vvas not till the very laſt point of the day: Now I hold that the night is no parte of the day, as formerly I haue ſhowne in the expoſition of the 4th comm. nor is the night to be counted &amp; rekoned, for any parte of the day goeing before it: ſo then, this text maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all for the Lords <hi>day;</hi> all that they can hence collect, is no more but this, that vve are bound to keepe euery 8th dayes <hi>night,</hi> or euery Lords day night, for a Sabbath night: and that we muſt preach as Paul did, till midnight &amp;c. Wherfore, if they will haue it that Pauls ſermon, &amp; their aſſembling begane in the morning, let them proue it; for the text hath no ſuch thing in it.</p>
                     <p>I know they are redy to ſay, theſe were times of perſecution, and they could not meete, till night, for feare &amp;c. but the text hath nothing of any perſecution now at <hi>Troas;</hi> and againe, ſince they mett to receiue the Lords Supper, there was no neede for them to meete in the day time or morning for that, the euening was ſoone enough: let them proue, that the Diſciples would haue mett ſooner, but for feare, if they can: and laſtly, had feare
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:21140:131"/>of perſecution hindred them, then would they not haue mett on the firſt <hi>day</hi> &amp;c. in the day time, leaſt they ſhould be ſeene walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſtreetes, &amp; entring into the common houſe of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie; they then vvould rather haue mett, erly before day light, or late after the day vvas ſhut in, leaſt they ſhould be ſeene &amp;c. but they aſſembled in the <hi>day</hi> time, &amp; therefore no feare of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I anſvver, admit that they mett in the morning of the Lords day, &amp; that the ſermon, &amp; the Lords Supper, vvere adminiſtred in the day time; yet what makes this for a Sabbath? for, theſe are euery dayes worke: preaching, is an euery dayes worke, and Lords Supper is ſo too; for Chriſt did eate the Lords Supper on a Thurſday night: all that can be hence collected is no more but this, that the Lords day, is a <hi>Lecture</hi> day, like as Tewſdayes and Thurſdayes be in many places of the kingdome. Now thers great difference betwixt a Sabbath day, &amp; a Lecture day.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, whereas they tell vs, that this inſtance in Act. 20.7. is an example of a Sabbath day, they are much miſtaken; for this is but a <hi>Sermon example,</hi> it is not a <hi>Sabbath example:</hi> great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betwixt a Sermon example, &amp; a Sabbath example: for, to proue a Sabbath example, they muſt proue that theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples did Reſt all day from morning to night; and then ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they performed thoſe holy actions, in conſcience of the day, &amp; of the 4th com. ſo then hitherto, they haue not proued, ſo much as any one Lords day, kept for a Sabbath day, in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times. Onely they haue groſly abuſed this portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo, as they haue done the former, to make the holy Ghoſt ſay what he neuer thought: this abuſe of Scripture would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by ſuch as make conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I anſwer, vvhereas they plead that Paul tarried 7 dayes at <hi>Troas,</hi> &amp; preached on the laſt day, it being the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and no mention of any ſermon but on the Lords day: if this will proue a Sabbath day, then haue I learned a way how to proue Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to be the Sabbath day, and that by the like arguing: for Paul tarried certaine dayes at <hi>Philippie,</hi> and preached on the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> to wit, the Saturday Sabbath, and baptized <hi>Lydia</hi> &amp; hir fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily on the ſame day, but no mention there is of any preaching
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:21140:131"/>on the Lords day, or an any other day, Act. 16.12.13.14.15. therefore Saturday muſt be the Sabbath day. 2. What though there be no mention that Paul preached in any of the 7 dayes, till this Lords day, doth it thereof follow, that he did not preach on any of thoſe dayes? Were not many things done, that were not mentioned? elſe the world could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teine the bookes &amp;c. Yet it may be proued that Paul preached on the day before this firſt day, or Lords day, to wit, on the Saturday Sabbath; for S. <hi>Luke</hi> teſtifieth of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> that vvhere Paul came, it vvas his <hi>cuſtome</hi> to preach euer vpon the Sabbath day, <hi>Paul as his manner was</hi> went in vnto them, &amp; iij Sabbath dayes diſputed with them Act. 17.2. Act. 18.4. And Paul who exhorted Timothie to preach the word in <hi>ſeaſon</hi> and out of ſeaſon; himſelfe I truſt was not idle at Troas, all thoſe 6 dayes which went before the Lords day. But then they turne to quaeries, and why preached he on this day? and why is this day mentioned, and none of the other? Thus when they can goe no further, they fale to beging of queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of vs; vvhen it is their part to proue it, vvhy this day rather then any other is mentioned; if any reaſon in it they can find, that vvill helpe them, let them produce it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I anſwer, that this ſermon of Pauls, was <hi>occationall</hi> &amp; <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordenary;</hi> and therefore no likelyhood that it was a Sabbath: neither is it likely, that this aſſembly at Troas, was a Sabbath aſſembly: for Sabbath aſſemblies are vvorkes of the day, not of day &amp; night both. Suppoſe therefore, that the Church at Troas, aſſembled in the morning of the Lords day, and ſo held on their aſſemblie whilſt midnight; yea, all night alſo; for ſo much is plaine by the text Act. 20.7.11. and ſo they held ſociety a whole day, and a vvhole night alſo, 24. howres: is this to be deemed, an ordenary Sabbath day worke? if it be, then muſt our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, aſſemble euery vveeke on the Lords day morning, and ſo hold on vntill Moonday morning, or elſe we are not like our patterne here, the Church at Troas: ſee if theſe mens eyes be in their heads, who would draw this Lords day, and action of the Church at Troas, vnto the erecting &amp; inſtitution of an <hi>ordenary</hi> Sabbath: for, if this Text be our Preſident for our new Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, then it is good reaſon, vve ſhould keepe our new Sabbath,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:21140:132"/>as this text vvitneſſeth they kept it. Againe, as for Pauls ſermon; Sabbath ſermons, are workes of the day, not of day and night both: Now if Paul begane his ſermon in the morning, the Text ſaith, that he <hi>continued it vnto midnight,</hi> v. 7. yea, that he had <hi>ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a long while to the dawning of the day,</hi> v. 11. If this were a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath ſermon, what a ſacke full of troubles were our new Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batharians in; for they muſt leaue their howre &amp; ij howre ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and make ſermons many howres long; yea, when they haue done preaching in the day time, they muſt too it againe, and preach in the night alſo, euen to midnight.</p>
                     <p>As this example at Troas, was extraordenary, ſo was it <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall;</hi> occationed by Pauls departure from them the next day: for he had tarried with them 7 dayes, and the next morning he was to take his iourney and departe from them, as the text ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, v. 7.13. and neuer to ſee their faces any more, nor they euer to ſee his face any more, as the Text ſpeaketh v. 25. Now in all probability, the Church at Troas knowing this, reſolued herevpon to come &amp; take their laſt ſight and farewell of him, &amp; to receiue the Lords Supper at his hands before his departure; and this was likely to be the occation of their aſſemblie now on this Lords day; yea, ſo much may be collected out of the Text Act. 20.7. Now the Brethren being aſſembled, Paul could doe no leſſe, then giue them a ſermon at his departure: and this, he that tooke all occations to build vp &amp; edifie the Church, tooke this <hi>occation</hi> to eſtabliſh theſe in the faith: and this, vpon this or the like occations, he vvould haue done, vpon any day of the weeke Sunday, Monday, or any other. Now what is this Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vnto vs, and to the erecting &amp; inſtituting of Sermons on the Lords day as a Sabbath day? All that can be collected hence, is but this, that vpon theſe or the like occations, people may be aſſembled together, &amp; the Miniſter may preach a ſermon to them, and that theſe things may be done, on that day of the weeke wherein the occation falleth out, be it Lords day, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, Tewſday or any other; and all this to be done, not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the time &amp; day wherein they are done ſuperſtitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in regard of the preſent <hi>occation</hi> onely: but behold our Miniſters haue hence collected by their magnified co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequences,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:21140:132"/>that we muſt aſſemble together, euery weeke for euer, vpon the Lords day, be there occations or no occations to moue thereto, I meane extraordenary occations; and this muſt be done in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the very time &amp; day, vvherein they vvill haue vs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble: how farre off are theſe departed from their Coppie and Preſident! Act. 20.7. they mett occationally, but we muſt meete occation or none; yea vvith a ſuperſtitiouſe reſpect of the time &amp; day we meet in: for vve find not that theſe at Troas, made any conſcience of the day and time vvherein they mett: vnleſſe you vvill ſuppoſe that all Sunday night, or euery Lords day night, is a ſanctified time for Sabbath dueties, and to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in conſcience. And vvhich is vvorſt of all, this time, collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their vaine conſequences out of this Text, vvherein they ſwerue from their Coppie, it muſt be preſſed vpon mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, as a parte of Gods worſhip; &amp; that in conſcience of it, men muſt neglect their callings, to their great damage, and that vpon perill of ſinne, and paine of damnation: is it not high time, theſe things were reformed?</p>
                     <p>But happily it vvill be ſaid by Miniſters, that this is an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apoſtle Paul, and of the Church of God at Troas, now examples bind conſcience, &amp;c. Whereto I anſwer 1. this is no Sabbath example, it is but a Sermon example. 2. If examples bind the Church now, then muſt rich men ſell their houſe and land, and lay the mony downe at the Miniſters feete, for ſo did the Church, Act. 4.34.35. and if all examples of the Apoſtles bind conſcience, then are Miniſters of all men in an ill caſe; for they muſt not onely ſtudy and preach painfully, but alſo muſt vvorke hard in ſome honeſt calling; for ſo did Paul, he laboured in his Trade of Tent making, Act. 18.3. they muſt not onely preach on the Lords day, but alſo, they muſt preach till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, for ſo did Paul: they muſt not onely preach in the Church, on the Lords day, but alſo from houſe to houſe in the vveeke dayes; for ſo did the Apoſtles, Act. 5.42. I but hereto they will reply, ſeing them ſelues in ſo ill a caſe, that theſe things were extraordenary, and peculiar to thoſe times, &amp; therfore bind not vs now whereto I anſwer, &amp; can they ſee the extraordinarineſſe in theſe examples; and can they not ſee alſo the extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:21140:133"/>of this example, of Pauls preaching at Troas? and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordenarineſſe of Peters Sermon, on Pentecoſt day, Act. 2.1. Where they pleaſe, they can ſee; &amp; where they pleaſe, they can not ſee at all.</p>
                     <p>For concluſion, if they will proue their Lords day a Sabbath by this text Act. 20.7. let them remember that beſids other things, this is their taske 1. to proue, that the Church aſſembled in the morning of the Lords day. 2. They muſt proue, that the people did refraine all ſeruile labour, at Troas, all the Lords day long, from breake of day in the morning vntill night: for, they might aſſemble together at Church, on the Lords day morning, about nyne of the clocke, as vve doe on Lecture dayes; and yet come from their laboures alſo, as we doe on a Lecture day: they might meete in the Church by 9 of the clocke, and yet they might haue ſpent 3 or 4 howres, euen all the morning before in their ordenary callings; now foraſmuch as they hould that it is vnlawfull for vs to ſpend the morning of the Lords day, in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile labour; and becauſe it is a ſpeciall parte of a Sabbath dayes duety, to reſt from our laboures, as it is in the 4th com. therfore, they muſt proue vnto vs, that theſe Diſciples at Troas, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine their vvorkes, all the day long, the morning as vvell as the after noone. 3. They muſt remember to proue vnto vs, that thoſe holy dueties, vvhich the Diſciples at Troas performed on the Lords day, they did them in conſcience of the 4th Comm. for, a people may heare a Sermon, in conſcience of that Com. of Pauls, <hi>preach the word. &amp;c. in ſeaſon &amp; out of ſeaſon,</hi> 2. Tim. 4.2. But this is not the 4th Comm. theſe are the maine things they ſhould ſpend their time in to proue; but of all the reſt, theſe 3 things, are neuer touched by them, thus the maine of all which ſhould be laboured in, is vtterly neglected; but vntill they proue theſe things, beleeue them that will for mee.</p>

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:21140:133"/>be not ſpecified in particular vvhat Commandements, Chriſt gaue them, yet it is gatherable what they vvere, by the practiſe of the Apoſtles afterwards; now their practiſe was to keepe the Lords day for a Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>Here vnto I anſwer 1. that whereas they pretend a practiſe of the Apoſtles in keeping the Lords day; they were ſo farr from a practiſe of it, as it cannot be ſhowne where any of the Apoſtles, kept two Lords dayes, in all their liues: now a ſingle action, is no practiſe. 2. I anſwer, admit that the Apoſtles kept the Lords day, yet I deny that it can be proued, that they kept it for a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; for the vtmoſt that can be proued, is but that they kept it for a <hi>Lecture day;</hi> if that: that is, that they preached a Sermon ſometimes vpon the Lords day: but a lecture day, is no Sabbath day. 3. I anſwer if the practiſe of the Apoſtles, after Chriſt his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, be a ſure note, that Chriſt whilſt he was vpon the earth, gaue the Apoſtles a Commandement for that practiſe; then ſurely, Chriſt gaue the Apoſtles a Commandement to keepe the Saturday Sabbath: for, Paul &amp; Barnabas, &amp; the Reſt with them, kept the Saturday Sabbath conſtantly, after Chriſt his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention; ſe for this purpoſe Act. 13.14.42.44. and Act. 16.13. and Act. 17.2. and Act. 18.4. thus it appeareth by their owne arguments, that the Saturday Sabbath is ſtill in force, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Chriſt too; &amp; yet they will not acknowledge it, but oppoſe it. 4. I anſwer, that it is abſurd for any to imagine once, that Chriſt gaue his Apoſtles a commandement for the Lords day: for this were to caſt a foule blurr on the Apoſtles, that Chriſt their Maſter, ſhould giue them a Commandement, to deliuer vnto the Churches, and they ſhold conceale it: whers then their fidelity? how could they ſay with Paul, Act. 20.27. that they had reuealed the <hi>whole counſaile of God, &amp; kept nothing back?</hi> vvhen they had kept back a precept for the Lords day Sabbath.</p>

                     <p>A 5th text out of the New Teſtament, alleaged and abuſed, for the Lords day, is 2.

                     <p>A 6th Text out of the New Teſtament, alleaged and abuſed for the Lords day, is 1. Cor. 16.2. <hi>Vpon the firſt day of the weeke, let euery on of you put aſide by himſelfe, and lay vp as God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered him, that then there be no gatherings when I come.</hi> Loe here ſay they was a collection for the poore, which collection, was an ordinance of the Apoſtle, as I haue <hi>ordeined</hi> in the Churches of Galatia, ſo doe yee. Now when there were collections for the poore, there muſt be aſſemblies; and when there were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, then there vvere ſermons; and on thoſe dayes in which were collections for the poore, and aſſemblies, &amp; ſermons, thoſe were Sabbath dayes. This text <hi>M. Yates</hi> hath vrged vpon me.</p>
                     <p>Herevnto I anſwer, 1. Here you ſee the foundation of all this argument, is from hence, that there vvas at Corinth a collection for the poore; and that there was alſo an Aſſembly; if therefore I ſhall make it appeare, that there vvas neither collection, nor aſſembly, then you will ſay this text is groſly abuſed, and that herein is no foundation for any new Sabbath. And firſt touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aſſembly; that here was no aſſembly or congregation ordeined by Paul, is plaine from the vvords of the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>apudſeipſum reponat,</hi> or, <hi>apud ſe ſeponat:</hi> let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you, <hi>put aſide by himſelfe:</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not here, of putting vp mony, in the congregation or aſſembly, but of putting it aſide by himſelfe: Now it is one thing to lay vp mony by a mans ſelfe; and an other to lay it vp with others in an aſſembly: for a man may lay vp mony by himſelfe, when he is at home, &amp; alone by himſelfe; and this is that vvhich the text ſpeaketh of; and this is not done in an aſſembly as they ſuppoſe,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:21140:135"/>but out of an aſſembly: if here vvere any grownd for them, for any aſſembly, the Apoſtle muſt haue ſaid, Let euery one of you, contribute vvith others, or in the aſſembly; or let euery one of you, put aſide from himſelfe, as men doe to Collectors in the Church; but he ſaith the quite contrary, let euery one, put aſide by himſelfe; vvherefore this ordinance of Pauls, vvas a duety to be done by euery man ſinglie &amp; alone by himſelfe at home; here then you ſee is no grownd for any aſſembly or Congregation.</p>
                     <p>Now I come to the collection, and I ſhall make it appeare, that Paul made no ordinance here at Corinth, for a <hi>collection:</hi> for, his ordinance vvas onely for a <hi>preparation</hi> to a collection: Now theſe ij differ much, to collect mony is one thing, and to prepare or make mony redy for a collection is an other thing: Paul indeed ſpake touching a collection, when he ſaid, <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the gathering for the Saints,</hi> 1. Cor. 16.1. but yet he did not here ordaine, that this collection whereof he ſpake, ſhould be then preſently made; this he gaue order for afterwards concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the time, when it ſhould be done; onely he would haue them in a readineſſe with their money, that ſo whenſoeuer after, he ſhould giue order for the collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be made, mens money and what they would beſtow, might not be to ſeeke, but laied vp by them, euery mans money by himſelfe, in a readineſſe: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as men were to giue with reſpect vnto their eſtats and abilities, <hi>as God had proſpered them,</hi> it was needfull there ſhould be a day appointed for them, wherein to caſt vp their accounts and rekonings, to ſee how God had proſpered them in their eſtats, and then that done, to lay vp by them, what they could ſpare, againſt the day that Paul ſhould ſend for it.</p>
                     <p>For the cleering of this text therfore, we may borrow light from 2 Cor. 9.5. where S. Paul ſpeaking of collections v. 1. he hath reference in this his ſecond Epiſtle, vnto the collection mentioned in his firſt Epiſtle 1. Cor. 16.2. as you may perceiue by theſe words, where he ſpeaketh of a collection <hi>appointed afore,</hi> or as our new Tranſlatoures haue it <hi>where of yee had notice before,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.5. now this collection, where of Paul had giuen them knowledg before, it was not made before, but to make ſtill, as appeareth by theſe things 1. in that he now telleth them
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:21140:135"/>of ſending the bretheren, as collectours, that they might finiſh their beneuolence, or make vp before hand their bounty <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, whereby you ſee this collection was yet to be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and made vp. 2. he ſſeth an argument to perſwade the Corinthians to a liberall contribution 2 Cor. 9.6. now this perſwaſiue argument had come too late, if the collection had bene paſt firſt: ſo by this text 2 Cor. 9.5. it appeareth, that what Paul ſpake in the 1 Cor. 16.2. it was not of any collection then to be made, but only it was a preparatiue, to a future collection; wherefore you ſee their grownd whereon they build is falſe grownd; for they cannot proue by this text, that here was either any collection vpon the Lords day, no nor any aſſembly: how then will they gather, that there was a Sermon on this Lords day, &amp; ſo a Sabbath, if they cannot proue that there was any aſſembly or congregation, on this Lords day? thus you ſee that hitherto they cannot proue by any one text, that there was at any time ſo much as any one Lords day kept for a Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>Now when they are at their furtheſt &amp; can goe no furder, then they fall to quaeries; but why (ſay they) was this collection, appointed vpon the firſt day of the weeke, rather then on the ſecond day, or ſome other? ſurely there was ſomething in that. Hereto I anſvver, if ſurely there vvas ſomething in it, then let them ſhew vs vvhat it vvas: for it is their parte to find it out if any thing there vvas, that might proue it a Sabbath day; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there vvas ſome thing in it, vvhy this collection or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiue, vvas on this day rather then on any other, but you knovv there may be many ſome things &amp; reaſons of it, &amp; yet none of them ſuch as will proue it a Sabbath day; let them refraine therefore this begging of queſtiones of vs, &amp; fale to prouing themſelves; let them proue it, that this collection or preparatiue appointed on the Lords day, rather then on any other day, muſt make it a Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſwer, if Paul did ordaine the Lords day for a Sabbath, to be kept by the Church of Corinth heere; vvhy did Paul him ſelfe, voluntarily omit the keeping of the Lords day, vvith the Church at Antioch, vvhen he had a moſt fit occation (as lately I haue ſhowne) &amp; did rather keepe the Sabbath day Act. 13.14.42.43.44.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:21140:136"/>When as yet he might haue kept the Lords day, if he vvould? one vvord of his mouth would haue done it. Surely had the Lords day bene a Sabbath day, Paul would haue kept it in all Churches vvhere euer he came, aſvvell in one as in an other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I anſvver, let all be granted, and yet it vvill not doe; ſuppoſe therfore that here vvas a collection, &amp; an aſſemblie, and a ſermon; yet it cannot by all theſe be proued a Sabbath day; all that can be hence collected is no more but this, that the Lords day vvas a collection day, &amp; an aſſembling day, and a ſermon day; that is, a <hi>Lecture</hi> day; but not a Sabbath day. For, to a Sabbath day, is more required then to haue an aſſembly, &amp; a collection, &amp; a ſermon; for all theſe 3. we haue on lecture dayes, in London, &amp; other partes of the kingdome, on Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, Thurſdayes &amp; other dayes of the vveeke, vvhich are no Sabbath dayes.</p>
                     <p>If the patrones of the Lords day, vvill proue that at Corinth they kept this day for a Sabbath, they muſt remember to proue theſe thinges; 1. That the people did refraine all ſeruile labour on the Lords day, from breake of day, till night; for this is a parte of the 4th com. <hi>In it, thou ſhalt do no manner of worke.</hi> 2. They muſt proue that they ſpent this Reſt, in holy exerciſes: And that they did both theſe in conſcience of the 4th com. the which ij things if they cannot proue out of this text, as it is moſt certaine they cannot, then haue they foully abuſed this portion of Scripture alſo; yea, &amp; not only this parte of Gods word haue they abuſed &amp; profaned, but alſo thereby haue they abuſed and corrupted, with errour, the mindes of ſuch their people, as are moſt ingenuouſe &amp; tractable: a thing much to be lamented of euery godly heart: thus by goeing about, to juſtifie their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite Sabbath, they add one ſinne vnto an other.</p>

                     <p>A 7th text out of the new Teſtament, which they alleage &amp; abuſe for the Lords day, is Reuel. 1.10. <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day &amp;c.</hi> Some from this text thinke this Lords day muſt be a Sabbath day, becauſe S. Iohn receiued a Reuelation
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:21140:136"/>in it: but fewe doe vrge it thus; &amp; thus there is not the leaſt force of prouing in it; for how will it appeare, that becauſe Iohn had a Reuelation on this day, that therfore it muſt be a Sabbath day? theres no likelihood that euer this can be proued: Ezekiel had a viſion or Reuelation from God, on the 5th day of the moneth Ezek. 1.1.2. muſt this 5th. day of the moneth be therefore a Sabbath for euer? But I come to the ſecond ſorte, &amp; theſe are the moſt of thoſe which vſe this text; they gather all from the name, that this day is called <hi>Lords day:</hi> but how they will frame an argument from this name Lords day, to proue it a Sabbath day, I cannot deuiſe.</p>
                     <p>Thouching their collections from this name I anſwer 1. Let them remember, that ſince they haue no com. from Chriſt for this day; &amp; therfore are put too it, to magnifie their reaſon &amp; conſequences, prouided they be neceſſary conſequences as they ſpeake, let them not forget I ſay, when they bring vs a reaſon hence, that it be not a probable one, but one of their neceſſary conſequences; if I miſtake me nor, they ſhall find ſome what to doe, to proue neceſſarily, from the bare name of a thing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Seing that Paul did voluntarily omit the keeping of the Lords day, when he might haue kept it, if he vvould but haue ſpake the word, as hath bene ſhowne out of Act. 13.14.42.44. thers no probability therfore to think, that any thing ſhould be intimated here in theſe vvords Lords day, to declare this day now to be a Sabbath day. 3. Foraſmuch as it ſhall hereafter be proued out of M. Perkins, that ſondry of the primitiue Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, did not obſerue the Lords day, for 300 yeeres after S. Iohns time, who can thinke, that in this Text S. Iohn did ratify the Lords day for a Sabbath, vvhen the Chriſtian Churches, vvhich immediatly ſucceded him, vvere ignorant of it? further, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as our Sauiour Chriſt, the Lord of this Lords day, did make it a trauailing day, vvhen he vvas vpon the earth; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought, that S. Iohn did intimate, by theſe words Lords day, that it ſhould be kept as a Reſting day, or Sabbath day; vnleſſe you ſuppoſe; that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Seruant, put holineſſe in that day, vvherin <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Lord, put none. 4. You haue a Text in Mat. 24.10. beſids many others in Act. 13.42.44. Act. 16.13.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:21140:137"/>Act. 17.2. Act. 18.4. <hi>pray that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day.</hi> Where our Sauiour Chriſt allowed a conſcience to be made of flying &amp; trauailing on the Sabbath day, that is, the 7th day Sabbath, and that 40 yeers after his death. Were the Patrones of the Lords day, but as vvilling to imbrace the Lords Sabbathes, as they are to vphould the Lords day, here vvere a text for them, that hath, by farr more probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of trueth, then this text hath Reuel. 1.10. but they bewray their partiality, when they will refuſe that which hath better grownds in Gods word, and imbrace that vvhich hath worſe grownds, yea no grownd at all. 5. It is a rule in expounding of Scripture, that vvords that are ſome vvhat ambiguouſe and doubtfull, be ſo conſtrued and expounded, as that they doe not contradict ſome other plaine &amp; expreſſe Text of Scripture: now in the 4th Com. vve haue a moſt expreſſe &amp; plaine Scripture, neuer yet repealed, <hi>Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour:</hi> now this Lords day, is the firſt of theſe ſixe dayes; wherfore theſe words Lords day, muſt not be ſo expounded, as if vve ſhould Reſt from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour on this day; for ſo vve make a contradiction in Scripture, by ſetting this text againſt the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com.</p>
                     <p>I come novv to anſwer more directly; &amp; firſt for this name Lords day: they take it for graunted that S. Iohn meante it of our Sunday, or Firſt day of the weeke; but it may bedoubted of: for our Sauiour Chriſt was Lord of the old Sabbath, <hi>The Sonne of man is Lord, euen of the Sabbath,</hi> Mark. 2.28. Wherefore, the 7th day Sabbath may truly be called the Lords day: now be it that our Sunday, or Firſt day of the weeke may alſo becalled <hi>Lords day,</hi> becauſe Chriſt our Lord roſe on it; So then, if both the 7th day of the weeke, and alſo the 8th day of the weeke, may both be called Lords dayes, it is your parte then to proue that by Lords day, S. Iohn meant that Lords day, which is our Sunday: it may be he meant it of the Lords day, vvhich is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe vve not with ſtanding, that S. Iohn meante it of our Sunday, vvhat argument can thence be collected? <hi>M. Perkins</hi> in his Caſes of Conſcience Chap. 16. Sect. 2. argueth thus, that <hi>this day is called the Lords day, as the laſt Supper of Chriſt, was called
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:21140:137"/>the Lords Supper; and that for this cauſe, that as Chriſt did Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the laſt Supper in roome of the paſſouer, ſo he ſubſtituted the firſt day of the weeke in roome of the Iewes Sabbath, to be a day ſet a parte for his owne worſhip.</hi> Touching this argument, I ſhall not need giue any other anſwer, then that reuerend diuine hath put into my mouth: for he doth ingenuouſly confeſſe it in the ſame place, that this is but <hi>a probable</hi> argument, ſaying, <hi>I ſuppoſe, for in theſe points ſtill we muſt goe by liklihoods; that this day is called the Lords day, as the laſt Supper of Chriſt, was called the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, &amp;c.</hi> Well, if then there can be no arguments drawne from this name Lords day, but <hi>ſuppoſitions,</hi> &amp; <hi>likelihoodes,</hi> vvhat haue we to doe with them? theſe are no neceſſary conſequence: for how ſhall a Miniſter with a ſafe conſcience, preſſe men pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily &amp; neceſſarily to a certaine keeping of the Lords day, vpon probable ſuppoſitions, likelihoods &amp; vncertainties? can an vncertaine &amp; doubtfull argument, bind men, vnto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine &amp; vndoubted practiſe? Miniſters muſt haue a care, and make a conſcience of it, that they doe not bind mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſtraiter, then Gods word doth: when God ſpeakes probably &amp; doubtfully, they muſt not ſpeake peremptorily &amp; certainly, this were to make Gods Lawes ſtraiter then they are: if ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be but a likely matter that the Lords day is a Sabbath, let Miniſters leaue it &amp; deliuer it to people but as a likely thing, ſo as if they profane it, it cannot be ſaid for certaine, that they ſinne in profaning it: but Miniſters novv a dayes are gone beyond <hi>Perkins,</hi> where he ſaw but <hi>likelihoods,</hi> they doe ſee <hi>certainties;</hi> &amp; dare from ſuch Textes as theſe preſſe mens conſciences, to the certaine &amp; peremptory keeping this Lords day, vpon <hi>paine</hi> of <hi>damnation;</hi> how they ſhall anſwer this to God I know not: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth them to forethinke of it. In the meane ſpace for the people, if they be wiſe, let them not ſuffer their conſciences, to be ſnared, bound, and inthralled, touching the Lords day, by ſuch arguments as theſe.</p>
                     <p>Yet further, that the vanity of this their collection from the name Lords day, may appeare, ſee it by the like of the day called the <hi>paſſeouer day,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Pentecoſt day,</hi> &amp; of the action caled the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> had not God added his <hi>word</hi> &amp; Com. to theſe

                     <p>Furthermore ſome argue out of this Text thus; that this Lords day is ſo called as Chriſts laſt Supper, is called the Lords Supper; novv the Lords Supper is ſo called, becauſe it was <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted</hi> in remembrance of Chriſt; and ſo this day is called Lords day, becauſe it vvas <hi>inſtituted</hi> for a Sabbath, in remembrance of Chriſt. Herevnto I anſwer, by deniall of this propoſition that, the Firſt day of the weeke is called Lords day, as Chriſts laſt Supper is called the Lords Supper: in theſe words they affirme, that there is the like reaſon, or the ſame reaſon, of the Lords day, &amp; of the Lords Supper: vvel, novv they haue affirmed it, in the next place it is their parte to proue it; for bare affirmations are no arguments; it is not therfore ſo, becauſe they haue ſaid it is ſo; for my parte I neuer heard it proued yet, that the Lords day is ſo called, for the ſame cauſes that Chriſts Supper is called the Lords Supper; neither doe I beleeue that euer I ſhall heare it proued. In the meane ſpace, let me ſhew the vanity of this affirmation, &amp; argumentation, by the like, thus.</p>
                     <p>This Lords day is ſo called, as the earth, is called the Lords earth, &amp; all that is therin: <hi>for, the earth is the Lords, &amp; all that therein is,</hi> 1. Cor. 10.26. Novv the earth is called the Lords earth, becauſe the Lord made it, &amp; all things therein, to ſerue man in his <hi>ordenary</hi> &amp; <hi>common</hi> vſe Geneſ. 1.29. Geneſ. 9.3. and ſo this day, is called Lords day, becauſe Chriſt ordeined it, for mans ordenary &amp; common vſe; that is, for a working day. If they may take liberty to giue a bare affirmation, &amp; then argue vpon it abſurdly, then ſo may I:2. it is ſaid that <hi>wee are the Lords,</hi> Rom. 14.8. Now wee Chriſtians, were redeemed by the Lord Chriſt, that we ſhould ſerue him in righteouſneſſe &amp; holineſſe, all the dayes of our life, Luk. 1.74.75. and if vve muſt ſerue
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:21140:138"/>him all the dayes of our life, then muſt we ſerue him in the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary workes of our calings: thus then I may argue; ſo is this day called Lords day, that it may be ſpent by ſeruing God, in the ordenary workes of our calings. 3. Iames is called the Lords brother, Gal. 1.19. Now may a man thus ſay, &amp; argue? this day is called Lords day, as Iames is called the Lords brother: novv Iames is called the Lords brother, becauſe he vvas allied to him; &amp; ſo is this day called Lords day, becauſe it is allied to him? ſee the abſurdety of ſuch collections as are made from this Text. 4. If this firſt day of the weeke, muſt be a Sabbath &amp; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting</hi> day, becauſe called Lords day; then muſt the earth reſt &amp; be no more tilled, becauſe it is called the Lords earth: &amp; then muſt we Chriſtians hereafter reſt from worke euery day, all our liues long becauſe vvee are called the Lords; &amp; the <hi>Lords redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:</hi> thus you ſee the vanity of their arguings from this Text: the like may be ſaid out of that Text, Luk. 17.22. where is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made of the Lords day, or <hi>day of the Sonne of man.</hi> But perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, they will obiect, that theſe inſtances are not like their caſe: for tis <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p> I confeſſe vve may be bould to render a reaſon, why Chriſts Supper was called the Lords Supper; becauſe vve haue a vvord of inſtitution added to the name, declaring its nature vſe and end, as 1. Cor. 11.20 23.24.25. but it is not ſo with the day, called the Lords day, Reuel. 1.10. Yee haue nothing but its bare name mentioned, &amp; not a word of the reaſon of the name, nor of the vſe and end of the day, ſo named; wherefore all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences from hence, muſt be as ſaith M.

                     </p>
                     <p>Some argue thus, that which in Scripture, is called the Lords, that is to be <hi>conſecrated</hi> to the Lord, and to his worſhip. I anſwer, as vvell may they thus argue &amp; conclud, that becauſe the earth is called the Lords, it muſt therefore be <hi>co ſecrated</hi> ſo to God, as it muſt <hi>reſt</hi> &amp; be tilled no more, &amp; be imploied vvholly and onely to Gods vvorſhip. And ſo Chriſtianes being called the Lords muſt <hi>reſt</hi> from vvorke, and onely worſhip God.</p>
                     <p>Some Miniſters argue thus, that this day is called Lords day, by way of <hi>excellency,</hi> as excelling all other dayes of the weeke, &amp; therfore it muſt be a Sabbath day; for Sabbath dayes excell all other dayes. Herevnto I anſwer, that euery excellency of a day, maketh not that day a Sibbath day, vnleſſe it excelleth as a Sabbath day: for example, good friday, &amp; ſo euery friday ſince, doe excell all other dayes of the weeke, in this regard, that on it Chriſt ſuffred his bitter paſſion for vs; &amp; yet is not euery friday ſince a Sabbath day. Hallow Thurſday, excelleth all dayes of the vveeke, in this, that on it Chriſt aſcended vp into heauen; &amp; yet is not Thurſday become a Sabbath day. So the Lords day excelleth all others in this, that on it Chriſt roſe, &amp; yet is not the Lords day a Sabbath day, ere the more for this excellency; As the Miniſter excelleth all other men, for a Miniſter; &amp; yet he is not therfore a Magiſtrate, ſo the Lords day may excell all other dayes, for a reſurrection day; and yet it is not therfore a Sabbath or Reſting day. Loe, with what idle ſtuffe, they fill peoples heads withall, to boulſter out their fancies.</p>
                     <p>Others there are, who thinke their bare naming of the day (Lords day) is argument ſufficient to convince any man, &amp; to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:21140:139"/>proue that the Lords day, muſt be a Sabbath day; ſo ſtrong they are in conceipt, &amp; ſo weake in argument: and thus they argue; why this day which we keepe it is called in the Scriptures, by S. Iohn, the <hi>Lords day,</hi> is it not? well &amp; what would you haue more then? is not this enough for any reaſonable man? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, if it be called the Lords day, then the Lords day let it be ſtill for me; I goe not about to giue it any other name, albeit it may be queſtioned: but this is that I ſay, that S. John did not call this day, <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> did he? if hee had called it Sabbath day, as he called it Lords day, then would I beleeue it had bene a Sabbath day; but now I beleeue that it is but a Lords day, &amp; not a Sabbath day; becauſe S. Iohn called it but Lords day, not Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p>Their laſt vpſhot, vvhich is a note that they are at <hi>non plus,</hi> is to quaeries, in ſteade of proofes; as thus; I but vvhy thinke you, this day was called Lords day, rather then any other? there was ſomething in it extraordenary doubtleſſe &amp;c. I anſwer, tis true, ſomething in it there vvas, &amp; ſomething extraordenary too, as namely, it was called Lords day, becauſe on it Chriſt roſe from the dead, &amp; ſo he did not vpon any other day: But if any thing they will haue more then this, let them ſhew vs vvhat it is, &amp; proue it when they haue done, but let them leaue this idle begging of queſtiones of vs, the which is a moſt frequent thing with them.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee what poore hould they haue for this new Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, from this text, Reuel. 1.10. full little did S. Iohn thinke when he wrote this Reuelation, &amp; mentioned the Lords day in it, that euer Chriſtians after him, would haue ſo abuſed this name, to the ſeting vp of a new Sabbath vpon it.</p>
                     <p>To conclud, ſince they will be ſo confident, as to collect a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary inſtitution, from a bare nomination, I deſire them firſt to proue it, that this name <hi>Lords day</hi> vvas of diuine impoſition: there is cauſe to doubt; there are many names in ſcripture, that are not diuinly impoſed, as <hi>Mars ſtreete, Purim, Mathew, &amp;c.</hi> ſo may this be too: and the rather conſidering that this name Lords day, was vnknowne in the Church for many yeeres after Chriſt: for, all the 4 Euangeliſts named it by the old name, <hi>the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:21140:140"/>firſt day of the weeke,</hi> onely: and ſo did S. Paul, Act. 20.7. it might therfore be ſo named firſt by the Church, &amp; afterwards by S.

                     <p>Thus you haue ſeene their Scriptures, &amp; what pittifull worke, they haue made with them; the feebleneſſe &amp; inſufficiency whereof, being ſingly conſidered of, &amp; well viewed, they full well ſeeing, though loath to confeſſe it; now they haue a new deuiſe, &amp; thats this, albeit (ſay they, or ſome of them) that theſe Scriptures, cannot proue the Lords day a Sabbath, ſinglie &amp; a lone conſidered, yet put them all together &amp; they vvill proue it. <hi>Quae non proſunt ſingula multa juvant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereunto I anſwer, it is well that at laſt they are forced to confeſſe it, that none of their Scriptures can proue the point, alone &amp; by themſelues ſingly; by yeelding this, they haue fairly yeelded their cauſe: for, I deſire of them, to ſhew me in one argument, framed out of all theſe textes together, how they can proue the Lords day a Sabbath; any better then they could out of them all ſinglie and alone conſidered one after an other: the vvhich can not be done. For, it is vvith theſe textes ſinglie, and together, as it is vvith a ſingle cipher, and a multitude of ciphers; if a ſingle cipher ſtandeth for nothing, then add to it an hundreth more ciphers, they increaſe not the number, the totall ſumme of them will be nothing ſtill; an 100 ciphers ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not make one ſingle vnity: And ſo it is vvith theſe Textes, if euery one of them ſinglie and alone, haue no force of prouing the Lords day a Sabbath, then add them all together, &amp; if there vvere an hundreth more of them, and all of them ſhall proue nothing: arguments doe not chang their nature being a multitude, from that they vvere ſingle: vvee eſteeme not of arguments by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but by vveight: many probabilities, cannot make one infallibility.</p>
                     <p>When a Chapman is to buy of a Merchant, many particular things of one kinde, packed together; the Chapman, leaſt he be deceiued, will take them aſunder, &amp; viewe them ſinglie one

                     <p>Amongſt all their reaſones for the Lords day Sabbath, this is one, that it is the fiteſt day for a Sabbath, &amp; therfore it muſt be a Sabbath: &amp; that it is of all other dayes the fiteſt, this they proue, becauſe Chriſt roſe on it, and Paul preached on it, and collectiones for the poore were made on it &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto I anſwer, 1. by demaunding of them in whoſe account this fitneſſe is to be allowed of? in Gods account, or in mans account: if they ſay in mans account, what hath man to doe in valuing &amp; making choiſe of dayes for Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:21140:141"/>God neuer left it vnto man to make choiſe of his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths; &amp; for man to take vpon him this office, it is but an vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. If they ſay in Gods account, then I anſwer, as for the 6. dayes, they are vnſit for a Sabbath in Gods account: becauſe God appointed them for labouring dayes, Sixe dayes, ſhalt thou labour &amp;c. Exod. 20.9. wherefore, if we may take that day for a Sabbath, which God eſteemeth fiteſt, then muſt we haue the Saturday Sabbath; for, that God eſteemed this the fiteſt day of all others, it appeareth in that he gaue a com. for the ſanctifying of this day aboue all others; God commanded this day, &amp; he neuer commanded any day beſids this day.</p>
                     <p>But hereunto they will thus reply, but we meane it of the 6 dayes only: that day of the 6 (begining at Sunday for the firſt of the 6) which is the fiteſt, that day muſt be Sabbath day: for as for the 7th day, we hould that to be aboliſhed: I anſwer, admit for argument ſake that the 7th day Sabbath is aboliſhed, which is more then euer they ſhall proue; let vs take them in their meaning, of the 6 dayes: yet it followeth not: for, this their arguing, is but a ſley begging of the queſtion, &amp; that by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in their argument for granted, which they ſhould firſt haue proued, to wit, that ſome one of the 6 dayes muſt be a Sabbath: and then this being proued, in the next place they may conſider which of the 6 dayes is the fiteſt for the Sabbath, and that in Gods account: for things may be fit for an vſe in mans account, which God neuer ordeined to that vſe.</p>
                     <p>This their arguing is like in abſurdety vnto this, a man hath 7 ſonnes, concerning theſe, thus one may argue, the eldeſt ſonne is a Lawyer, becauſe he is the fiteſt of all the reſt: the eldeſt ſonne, is a Phiſitian, becauſe he is the fiteſt for a Phiſitian: and yet for all this fitneſſe, he is neither Lawyer, nor Phiſitian: the eldeſt ſonne is fiteſt for a gentleman, &amp; yet he may be a beggar. Saul of all men preſent, was fiteſt to offer ſacrifice, &amp; yet God neuer ordeined him to offer ſacrifice: ſo the Lords day, may in a ſenſe be ſaid to be the fiteſt for a Sabbath, and yet God neuer ordeined, it for a Sabbath: but theſe are idle things; firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them handle their argument prouing that Chriſt hath ordeined any one, or ſome one of the 6 dayes; and then let them
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:21140:141"/>proue it ſhewing that the Lords day is fiteſt: when a man goeth into a glouers ſhopp, he muſt not vſe ſuch logicke as this, this paire of glones is ſiteſt for mee, therfore they are mine: he muſt firſt know if the glouer will parte whith them ſo or not: for there muſt be ſomething elſe beſides fitneſſe, or elſe you muſt goe whith out them: ſo firſt let them ſhew vs that Chriſt will haue one of the 6 dayes, and then let them ſhew which of the 6. hee will haue.</p>
                     <p>In the meane ſpace I will diſproue them, and ſhew that none of the 6 dayes are fit for a Sabbath: for 1. God with ut any repeale bath giuen a com. that theſe 6 day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s wee ſhould labour: Exod. 20.9. and therefore theſe 6 dayes are not fit any of them for a Sabbath. 2dly I will ſhevv that of all the 6 dayes, the Lords day is not fit for a Sabbath: and that becauſe Chriſt, and his Diſciples, vvith his approbation, trauailed on this day at leaſt 15 miles, vvhich vve knovv of, as hath bene proued out of Luk. 24.13.15.33.36. the vvhich hee vvould neuer haue done, if hee had iudged it fit for a Sabbath day. 3dly, S. Paul did voluntarily omit the keeping of the Lords day, vvhen he might haue kept it vvith thoſe Chriſtians at Antioch, for but a vvord ſpeaking, as hath bene ſhovvne out of Act. 13.14.42.43.44. vvhich Paul vvould not haue omitted, if he had iudged this Lords day fiteſt for a Sabbath. Wherefore none of the 6 dayes are fit in Gods account for a Sabbath, no not the Lords day it ſelfe: they muſt therefore bring ſome other &amp; better argument, then this of fitneſſe, to proue the Lords day a Sabbath: of all our Lambes, thoſe vvhich are ſpotleſſe, are fiteſt for a ſacrifice, &amp; yet no man muſt novv Sacrifice them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſvver to their reaſon vvhere by this argument is prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: they proue the Lords day, to be fiteſt for a Sabbath day, becauſe certaine famouſe vvorkes vvere done theron, as 1. Chriſt roſe on it. 2. appeared on it. 3. the holy Ghoſt deſcended on it. 4. Peter preached, converted 3000. &amp; Baptiſed them on it; 5. Paul preached on it 6. there vvas collections on it, and this reaſon is very plauſible with common people: But I deny that theſe things doe fit a day for a Sabbath day, in Gods account: (as for mans account, I regard not what he accountes,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:21140:142"/>or thinks fit in matters neceſſary to be obſerued vpon paine of damnation, &amp; in matters of Gods worſhip) &amp; I deſire them to ſhew vs, how they come to know Gods minde in this point; hath God at any time reuealed it, that ſuch actiones as are forementioned, ſhould fit the dayes wherin they were done, for Sabbathes? or hath the Church of God at any time, found out Sabbathes, or made choiſe of Sabbathes, by ſuch and the like actiones? or hath God left it to the liberty and vviſedome of men, to chooſe him out his Sabbathes, by ſuch like actiones? if none of theſe can be ſhovvne how dare they be ſo preſumptuous to affirme, that ſuch actiones doe fit the dayes vvherin they were done, for Sabbathes? mans reaſon, is a more blind thing, in the dueties of the firſt Table, then in the dueties of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, now the point of a Sabbath, is a matter of the firſt Table; dare men be ſo audaciouſly bould then vvith their reaſon &amp; conſequences heere? yea, &amp; ſuch poore reaſones, and friuolouſe conſequences? it ſtands not vvith the feare of God, and reuerence of Gods Majeſtie, to be ſo bould vvith God. I vviſh therfore, that men, eſpecially Miniſters, vvould make leſſe vſe of their reaſon &amp; conſequences, and more vſe of the Scriptures and conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Further I anſwer, that if men will be directed by examples in the Scripture, for the erection &amp; chooſing of dayes for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſolemnities, they ſhall find that ſuch famouſe actions, haue not cauſed thoſe very dayes, vvherein they vvere done, to be <hi>holy dayes,</hi> but God, and the Church, haue made choiſe of the next dayes after: Thus, God ended his vvorke of Creation on the 6th day, now he ſanctified the 7th day, which is the day after: &amp; the Church Eſter. 9. did likewiſe; for thoſe Iewes, who had deliuerance from <hi>Hamans</hi> conſpiracy, on the 13th day of the moneth, they kept the 14th day of the moneth, the day after, a day of feaſting &amp; ioye v. 17. &amp; thoſe Iewes who had deliuerance on the 14th day of the moneth, they ſolemniſed the 15th day of the moneth, the day after v. 18. wherefore if they would follow the Church of the Iewes, then muſt they thinke, that theſe famouſe actiones, muſt be remembred, not on the day wherein they were done, the Lords day, but the day after it, on
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:21140:142"/>
                        <hi>Moonday,</hi> &amp; this day muſt be our new Sabbath: or, if they vvill imitate God, and borrovv any light from him, then muſt they thinke that the day after all is done, muſt be the Sabbath; and as God ſet vp the 7th day, in remembrance of his vvorke of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the 6 dayes, ſo they are to thinke that Chriſt (vvho in this pointe imitated God, as they ſay) ſet vp the 9th day of the vveeke, in remembrance of his worke of Redemption, done on the 6th, 7th, &amp; 8th dayes of the vveeke: &amp; ſo all thoſe notable actiones, ſhould betoken vnto vs, that Moonday is our nevv Sabbath day, it being the day after. We vvill be thought to grownd this Lords day vpon Scripture, &amp; yet not follow either the example of God, or of the Church of God, recorded in Scripture; for we will not keepe the day after, but the very day, vpon which thoſe actiones were done.</p>

                     <p>But herevnto I anſwer, by the like reaſoning, ſhewing that by as good reaſon as this is; we may haue euery friday &amp; euery thurſday Sabbathes alſo: for friday, may not a man ſay thus, friday muſt be our Sabbath day; becauſe on this day, Chriſt ſuffered for vs on the croſſe, it is Chriſts <hi>Paſsion</hi> day: and can any aske why friday ſhould be Sabbath day, ſince it was Chriſts Paſſion day? for thurſday, may not a man ſay as much for it alſo? Thurſday muſt be our Sabbath day, becauſe on this day, Chriſt aſcended vp into heauen &amp;c. Thus you ſee by like reaſon we may as well haue 3 Sabbathes in a weeke as this one of Lords day. If any ſhall obiect that the Lords day was the greateſt, &amp; therfore moſt fit, that it before the other ij ſhould be the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; I anſwer, if we may compare them, friday vvas the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; for on it Chriſt bore the vnſupportable vvrath of his father for vs, vvhich made him cry out, <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:21140:143"/>forſaken me?</hi> but on the Lords day, there was onely Chriſts ſoule put into his dead body, &amp; ſo reuiued againe, now it was agreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er matter (as I think euery one will confeſſe) for the Diety, to ſupport the humanity, on his Paſſion day, vnder that vnſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table wrath of God; then to put his ſoule into his dead body, in his reſurrection day.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly I anſwer, how come they by this knowledg, that they can ſay, that this day muſt be a Sabbath day, becauſe Chriſt roſe on it? is not this one of their audaciouſe &amp; preſumptuouſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones, who are bold to affirme what they lift, in the matters of Gods worſhip? ſuer I am the Scriptures ſay no ſuch thing; nor doe they relate any ſuch matter, when they ſpeake of Chriſt his Reſurrection. I find the Scriptures thus ſaying, that Chriſt died for our ſinnes; &amp; <hi>roſe againe</hi> for our <hi>iustification</hi> Rom. 4.25. where we heare, what vſe we are to make of Chriſts reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, that it vvas to iuſtifie vs; but vve no vvhere reade, that Chriſt roſe, to make the Lords day a Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p>As for this action of Chriſts riſeing on this day, can any man thinke, that God vvould raiſe vp nevv ordinances in his Church as this Lords day Sabbath is, by a bare <hi>action,</hi> vvithout a vvord of <hi>inſtitution</hi> added to it? ſuppoſe vve that Chriſt at his laſt Supper, had onely brake the Bread; &amp; giuen a morſell to this man, &amp; a morſell to that man, without any words of inſtitution added vnto this action, to declare vnto them what they ſhould doe with the breade, and what vſe they ſhould make of it: and ſuppoſe be had onely giuen the Cup to this man to drinke, &amp; to that man to drinke, and neuer ſaid any thing vnto them, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Cup; tell me now, could the Apoſtles without a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle haue knowne what vſe they ſhould make of this bread, &amp; of this wine? Why ſo it is here, Chriſt roſe vpon this Lords day, but neuer added any word of inſtitution vnto it, to ſignifie vnto vs, that therefore he roſe on this day, becauſe his Church ſhould keepe it for a Sabbath; how then I pray can any the patrones of our Lords day Sabbath, gather by their conſequences, any thing from this bare action of Chriſts riſing on this day?</p>
                     <p>Nay let me come neerer, ſuppoſe the Iewes, had read it in the Scripture, that God himſelfe Reſted on the 7th day: but
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:21140:143"/>had neuer read it in the 4th com. that they ſhould imitate God, and Reſt on the 7th day alſo; how could they haue gathered, from that bare action of Gods Reſt on the 7th day, that they ought in conſcience to imitate God, &amp; Reſt on the 7th day alſo, when God had added no com. or word of inſtitution vnto his owne Reſt for their direction? what, can men know Gods minde, without his <hi>word</hi> to teach it them? yis doubtleſſe, our nevv Sabbathairans can; a bare action, vvithout any vvord of inſtitution, is enough for them: had theſe but ſene Chriſt breake the bread onely, it had bene enough for them; or heard ſay, that God Reſted on the 7th day, theſe needed no more: it is enough they knovv thus much, that Chriſt roſe vpon the Lords day, they can convert this to their owne vſe well enough, to deceine the ſimple, &amp; cooſine themſelues.</p>

                     <p>An other argument they haue for the Lords day, and that is this; <hi>If the Iewes kept a Sabbath in memory of the Creation, then much more ought we Chriſtianes to keepe a Sabbath in memory of the Redemption.</hi> The reaſon hereof they ſay is this, becauſe the <hi>worke of Redemption, is greater then the worke of creation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer firſt to their argument: &amp; herein they haue altered the ſtate of the queſtion, by putting in the vvord <hi>keepe</hi> into their argument, in ſteade of the word <hi>institute</hi> or <hi>ordeine:</hi> for our queſtion is not about the keeping of the Lords day, but about the inſtitution &amp; ordination of the Lords day: let them therefore firſt proue that the Lords day vvas inſtituted once, &amp; appointed by God for a Sabbath, &amp; then they may ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the labour of prouing vnto vs, that vve muſt keepe it: for vve are not vnwilling to keepe it, if once it be proued to be a Sabbath: this is but a peece of their Sophiſtry to proue one thing, vvhen they ſhould proue an other.</p>
                     <p>Behold vvhat difference there is betwixt theſe ij Sabbathes; and the practiſe of the Iewes, &amp; our practiſe: for there vvas an expreſſe commandement to the Iewes to keepe that Sabbath in memory of the Creation; but there can be no commandement ſhowne vs from Chriſt or his Apoſtles, for vs to keepe the Lords
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:21140:144"/>day in remembrance of the redemption: wherefore we are not bound vnto this new Sabbath, as they were vnto the old Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: for there is not the like reaſon: this ſophiſtry euery man may ſee.</p>
                     <p>I come now to their reaſon, they ſay the Redemption is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the vvorke of Creation: Herevnto I anſwer, to know vvhither it be greater or not, vvould coſt more labour then this their reaſon is worth, vvherefore for argument ſake, I ſuppoſe it is greater: but heere I demaund of them to whom it is greater? Whither it be greater vnto all men, or but vnto ſome men? their anſwer vvill be, that the vvorke of Redemption is greater vnto the elect, vnto the redeemed, and to thoſe onely vvhich haue faith: Well then, the Redemption is neither greater, nor great, nor any thing at all, to thoſe vvhich are not elected, not redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and vvhich liue &amp; dye vvithout faith; of theſe ij ſortes of people, the elect are the fewer number; the vnbeleeuers are the greater number: Well then, ſee how theſe things hange to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the thing they muſt proue, is that we Chriſtians, that is all we Chriſtians, euen euery one vvithin the pale of the Church that is baptiſed, all theſe ought to keepe the Lords day, for a Sabbath, in memory of the redemption, vvhen as the one halfe of theſe are not redeemed: and their reaſon to bind all &amp; euery man, thus to keepe a remembrance of this redemption, is becauſe the vvorke of redemption is greater vnto ſome onely of theſe men: How abſurd is this, that euery man ſhould be bound to keep a ioyfull memory, of that thing, which doth belong but vnto ſome of them onely, as not to the one halfe of them! this is as if they would vndertake to perſwade not onely Engliſh men, but alſo Dutch men, &amp; French men, to keepe a yeerly ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full remembrance vvith vs, for our deliuerance from the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard in 88: Why, vvhat haue French &amp; Dutch to doe vvith our deliuerance in 88? this concerned not them, it vvas not their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance: ſo, vvhat haue ſuch to doe, to keepe a ioyfull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance euery Lords day, for the redemption, vvhen it belongeth not vnto them, they being vnbeleeuers, and ſuch as loue not the Lord Ieſus? Wherefore, they cannot preſſe this their new Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of Lords day, by this their reaſon, vpon any but vpon ſuch
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:21140:144"/>as they ſee by their fruits, doe alredy beleeue: ſuch as doe not yet beleeue, vvhich commonly are the greater number, theſe are not tyed vnto the keeping of this Lords day: behold vvhat a Sabbath they haue then; to vvit, ſuch a one, as onely the <hi>fewer</hi> number of the Church &amp; Pariſh are tied to keepe it, as for the <hi>greater</hi> number of our Citties, Townes, &amp; Pariſhes, theſe are not bound to keepe it: this their reaſon therefore doth bewray the idleneſſe of the cauſe; for vve muſt haue ſuch a Sabbath, as the <hi>reaſon</hi> of it doth belong vnto all, and to euery man, none excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſuch is the Saturday Sabbath, vvhich is to be kept in memory of the Creation; now all &amp; euery man hath a benefit by the Creation, and therefore all are bound to it, none excepted: but it is not ſo with the Sunday Sabbath: for a fewe onely haue reaſon to keepe it.</p>
                     <p>Yet further to diſcouer the vanity of this argument, ſince they vvill haue vs keepe a Sabbath in remembrance of the <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I demaund of them, hovv often they vvould haue vs keepe a Sabbaah in memory of the Repemption, once euery 7th day, ofter, or ſeldomer? they vvill anſwer once euery 7th day: vvhy ſay I, that is <hi>Iewiſh,</hi> and ſauoureth of <hi>Iudaiſme,</hi> to obſerue a 7th day: this they haue learned from the Iewiſh Sabbath; vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince they doe ſo abhorre Iudaiſme &amp; the 7th day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, vvhy doe they imitate the <hi>Jewes</hi> herein, and the 7th day Sabbath, by chooſing a 7th day? the 7th day, is in imitation of Gods reſt on the 7th day: and in memory of the Worlds crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, finiſhed at the 7th day: but vve are Chriſtians, and as they ſay, <hi>all things are become new, old things are paſſed away,</hi> vvell then, vve muſt now imitate <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Redeemer, as the Iewes did <hi>God</hi> the Creatour; and we muſt fetch light from the vvorke of <hi>Redemption,</hi> to know how often to keepe our new Sabbath, as the Iewes did by Gods direction from the vvorke of <hi>Creation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If then we muſt imitate Chriſt the Redeemer, as did the Iewes God the Creatour, then muſt we trauaile too &amp; fro vpon the Lords day, for ſo did Chriſt himſelfe. 2. If we muſt fetch light, hovv often to keepe our nevv Sabbath, from the vvorke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, as the Iewes did from the worke of Creation, then muſt we (ſince all things are become new) take vp a new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:21140:145"/>of time alſo, vve muſt no longer regard a 7th day, but now we muſt regard the third day: for, as God was ſixe dayes in the worke of creation &amp; reſted the 7th: ſo Chriſt vvas three dayes in the worke of redemption, &amp; roſe, &amp; reſted the third day: on good friday; he ſuffred vpon the croſſe; on Saturday, &amp; on a parte of the Lords day, he lay in the graue; ſo you ſee the vvorke of redemption, coſt Chriſt 3 dayes worke; vvherefore, if they vvill imitate Chriſt, they muſt keepe euery third day, for a Lords day, &amp; for a new Sabbath; &amp; ſo they ſhall keepe two Sabbathes in a weeke or thereabouts: &amp; if they doe not thus, they may talke vvhat they vvill, that all things are become new; &amp; that as the Iewes kept a Sabbath in imitation of God at the Creation, ſo vve in imitation of Chriſt in the redemption; but vvhere is their imitation of Chriſt? doe they trauaile too &amp; fro, &amp; follow their callings on the Lords day, as Chriſt did? &amp; doe they keepe euery third day a Lords day, and Sabbath day, as Chriſt roſe vpon the third day? no ſuch matter.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, whereas they ſuppoſe, that we haue as greate neede of a Sabbath, to keepe a memory of the Redemption, as the Iewes had of a Sabbath, to keepe in memory the Creation. I deny it: for God had giuen the Jevves, the Sabbath day and it alone, to keepe in memory his Creation, &amp; therfore it vvas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe they had no other helpes: but for vs, &amp; for the Redemption, vve haue two <hi>Sacraments,</hi> Baptiſme &amp; the Lords Supper, to keepe in memory the Redemption, &amp; theſe are helps enough, ſo as there is no neceſſity of a Sabbath day alſo, for the ſame end. <hi>Doe this in Remembrance of mee,</hi> ſo hereby then the Redemption ſhall be kept in memory, all though vve haue no Lords day Sabbath at all. There is neede therfore to haue a Sabbath to keepe memory of the Creation, when there is no neede to haue one to keepe memory of the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>They haue alſo an other argument, as vaine as this paſt: thus, If God inſtituted a Sabbath in memory of the creation, then ſo did Chriſt inſtitute a Sabbath in memory of the redemption. But they cannot proue this conſequence, it is onely their naked affirmation; wherefore my bare deniall of it, ſhall be ſufficient,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:21140:145"/>vntill they proue it: you may ſee this argument further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſted vpon, in my former booke, Pag. 48. others argue thus: the greater work muſt carry the honour of the day, &amp;c. Anſ: the greater work may haue greater honour, though not of the ſame Kind: for the creation, may haue the <hi>greate</hi> honour of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, to remember it: and the Redemption, may haue the <hi>greater</hi> honour, of not one but two Sacramentes, to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it.</p>

                     <p>An other argument for the Lords day they haue, &amp; it is this; <hi>the Authority of the Magiſtrate hath Commaunded it; and therfore we muſt keepe it, &amp;c.</hi> Let no man thinke I frame this argument of mine owne heade; for as I haue often heard common people vſeing it, ſo I haue bene vrged with it my ſelfe, by a diuine, and none of the meaneſt: neither neede they be aſhamed to heare of this argument in publike, which they doe vſe in priuate: I aſſure them, it is the beſt argument which they haue for the Lords day: none of all theſe paſt are like vnto it: for <hi>euery ſoule muſt be ſubiect vnto the higher powers,</hi> Ro. 13.1. if therfore the Magiſtrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth vs to keepe it, we muſt keepe it.</p>
                     <p>To this argument I anſwer, 1. that our queſtion is not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vve muſt <hi>keepe</hi> the Lords day, or not keepe it; but whither Chriſt hath inſtituted &amp; <hi>appointed</hi> it for a Sabbath or not; let this be firſt proued, &amp; then vve vvill be redy to keepe it, though this argument of Authority be wanting.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſwer, if this Lords day hath no higher authority then from the Magiſtrate, then doth it not bind conſcience ſimply &amp; &amp; by it ſelfe, but as all indifferent things doe which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Magiſtrate: Yea, the Lords day it ſelfe muſt be ranked amongſt indifferent things, where of the Magiſtrate, may properly make Lawes: Yea whereas the Magiſtrate now commandeth the Lords day to be kept, if it hath no higher Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority then of the Magiſtrate, then hee may alter the ſolemnity of the day, from Sunday, to Moonday, to Tewſday, or to any other day of the weeke: Yea, &amp; not onely alter it, but alſo at his pleſure nullifye it, &amp; vtterly forbide keepeing of it any more.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:21140:146"/>And ſo the Tenour of your new Sabbath will proue but a fickle and inconſtant thing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I anſwer, if our Lords day ſtandeth by virtue of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it not kept by virtue of the 4th com. but by virtue of the 5th Com. for it is the 5th Com. that inioyneth obedience to our Superioures: wherefore, then muſt Miniſters no more preſſe the 4th Com. vpon the Lords day, but the 5th Com. they muſt no more ſay, Remember the Sabbath day: But now they muſt ſay, Honour thy Father, &amp; thy Mother: when they would haue men ſanctify the Lords day. And people, they muſt no more ſay they keepe the Lords day in conſcience of the 4th Com. but in conſcience of the 5th Com. and thus alſo, ſhall the 4th Commandement be vtterly aboliſhed and out of all vſe in the Church.</p>
                     <p>This Lords day Sabbath then may be doubly conſidered of, as it is commaunded by God, or as it is Commaunded by the Magiſtrate; as it is commaunded by the Magiſtrate, ſo I doe no waies oppoſe it, let it ſtand ſo ſuch as it is in that reſpect, ſo long as the Magiſtrate pleaſeth, &amp; as little while as hee pleaſeth: but I oppoſe our Miniſters onely, who ſay this Lords day ſtands by diuine ordination from God, &amp; ſo intangle the peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in this reſpect, making more Commandements (as we ſay) then tenn, or making Lawes to bind conſcience, where God maketh none.

                     <p>Thus vve haue anſwered to all their <hi>Artificiall</hi> arguments; &amp; now we come vnto their <hi>Teſtimonies:</hi> the firſt whereof is <hi>Gods bleſſing of this day,</hi> &amp; Gods <hi>curſeing</hi> of the profaners of it; &amp; firſt of the former; ſay they, Gods bleſſing of this day, to the greate edification of the Church, is a ſigne that God approueth of this day.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto I anſwer, it is one thing for God to bleſſed <hi>this day</hi> &amp; it is an other for him to bleſſe <hi>his ordinance</hi> in the day: Gods ordinance in the day, is preaching &amp; praying, now God in
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:21140:146"/>mercy doth vſually bleſſe theſe ordinances of his, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably vſed, vpon any day <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, or <hi>Lecture</hi> day: now we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh betwixt Gods bleſſing of the day: vvherin theſe are performed, &amp; Gods bleſſing of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances them ſelues; they therfore miſtake things, that argue thus, that God bleſſeth the day, when they ſhould ſay, God bleſſeth his ordinances in the day: for it followeth not, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God bleſſeth his ordinances done in the day, that he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bleſſeth alſo the day &amp; time, wherein theſe ordinances are done; no more then God bleſſeth the place wherin theſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are performed.</p>
                     <p>Let me ſhew you the vanity of this arguing by the like caſe; Gods bleſſing doth vſually accompany painfull labour; now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome profane Tradſman ſhould vvorke all day long vpon the Sabbath day, or Lords day, &amp; finding at night his work to haue increaſed &amp; thriuen in his hands; might he argue thus, God hath bleſſed this day vnto me for a working day, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here after I ſhall vſe it for a working day; for Gods bleſſing vpon my laboures this day, is a ſigne that God approueth my action, &amp; alloweth of it for a working day?</p>
                     <p>The other part of this argument, is that <hi>God hath curſed the profaners of this Lords day,</hi> and this is a ſigne that God appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth of the day. For we reade in <hi>bookes,</hi> ſet forth by ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins, of many remarkable iudgements of God, which haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falne the profaners of the Lords day. Herevnto I anſwer, 1. that in controuercies about points of Religion, vve muſt not proue things, by the arguments of proſperity &amp; aduerſity: for theſe are no certaine ſignes of Gods vvill and pleaſure; no man for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, <hi>knowes loue or hatred, of all that is before them,</hi> Eccl. 9.1. vve muſt to the Scriptures in this caſe; for there God hath manifeſted his vvill; but you may perceiue they be almoſt out of breath, in as much as they are inforced to flye the Scriptures, and hale in any thing, that may helpe to make a noiſe, and put ſome culler vpon the matter before the ſimple. By this argument vve may conclude that the <hi>Palatinate</hi> his cauſe vvas naught, and the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> his cauſe vvas good; becauſe God croſſed the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>

                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:21140:147"/> 2. We are to diſtinguiſh of the day, from the dueties in the day: now we may impute thoſe curſes of God, vvhich lighted vpon men on the Lords day, vnto their contempt of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of preaching and prayers performed in that day: it is rather to be thought, that God puniſheth the contempt of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, then the neglect of the day: for ſuch as profane the Lords day &amp; come not at Church then to ſerue God, vvhen euery body doth ſerue God, it is a ſigne that they be ordenary contemners of Gods worſhip &amp; ſeruice; moſt iuſtly therefore may God plague them for contempt of his ordinances, when they are growne to that height of impiety, that they dare orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily neglect Gods worſhip, yea and vpon ſolemne times alſo, appointed by the Church, and vvhen all men meete together to vvorſhip God; then to ſhew a contempt, is a greater ſinne then otherwiſe: ſo it is rather the contempt of Gods ordinances, then the neglect of the day, that God puniſheth.</p>

Perkins, that this Lords day, vvas not kept in the primitiue Churches conſtantly, as now we keepe it, in our Churches; for it was not kept vntill Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours eſtabliſhed it, now the firſt Chriſtian Emperour that enacted a Law for the Lords day, as farr as I can find, was <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> &amp; this was about 300 yeeres after Chriſt; ſo that this Lords day, was not onely not kept by the primitiue Churches, but alſo it was not kept in all probability, not of 300 yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt: ſo that they haue no greate cauſe to alleage the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the primitiue Church for their Lords day.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſvver, but admit the primitiue Churches had kept it conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly in all places, &amp; at all times alwaies; yet there is a tvvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fould keeping or ſolemnizing of a day; the one is the keeping it a <hi>Sabbath day;</hi> the other is the keeping of it for an <hi>Holy day:</hi> now I deny that they kept it for a Sabbath day; for, it is moſt lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they kept it for an holy day, vvhich is more remiſe and ſlenderly kept then a Sabbath day: and this appeareth 1. by <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Magneſians</hi> where he exhorteth both to the keeping of the Sabbath day, &amp; alſo to the keeping of the Lords day, &amp; both in one &amp; the ſame page: novv it is not likely that Ignatius did exhorte his people to keepe two Sabbath dayes in a vveeke, the Saturday &amp; Sunday; and therfore it is likely that the Lords day they kept it ſlenderly as an holy day. Againe, hee cales the Lords day there, the <hi>Quene &amp; Princeſse</hi> of dayes; where you ſee he left an higher roome for the Sabbath day, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it as the <hi>King</hi> &amp; prince of dayes; &amp; therfore it is likly
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:21140:148"/>kept not the Lords day, as they did the Sabbath day. Yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, it is to be noted, that Ignatius exhorting his people, to the keeping of both the Sabbath day, &amp; the Lords day, he refuſeth to giue that word vnto the Lords day, vvhich he giueth to the Sabbath day, &amp; vvhich is moſt proper for a Sabbath day: for, in exhorting to the Sabbath day, he vſeth this vvord <hi>Sabbatizet,</hi> but in exhorting to the Lords day, he changeth the vvord and vſeth this vvord <hi>celebret</hi>

                        </gap> which in liklihood noteth a difference in the vſe of theſe two dayes, the one being kept as a Sabbath, the other as a Feſtiuall day.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It appeareth by a law made by <hi>Constantine,</hi> as any may reade it reported, by M. <hi>Fox</hi> in his booke of Martyres, the new Edition pag. 93. thus; <hi>The Sunday hee commanded to be kept holy of all men, and free from all Iudiciary cauſes, from markets, Martes, fayers, &amp; all other manuall laboures, onely huſhandry excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> Where you ſee the workes of huſbandry, as plowing &amp; the like excepted, this might be done in thoſe dayes, and in that Church, on the Lords day. Now Conſtantine was the moſt famouſe defender of the Lords day, of any Emperour; &amp; would he thinke you haue giuen men leaue to goe to plough &amp; carte on the Lords day, if hee had eſteemed it as a Sabbath day? no ſurely; for this is plaine contrary to the very letter of the 4th com. <hi>In it thou ſhalt doe no manner of worke:</hi> no not in <hi>earing time</hi> nor in <hi>harueſt</hi> Exod. 34.21. wherefore ſince Conſtantine gaue leaue to plough &amp; ſowe, &amp; the like workes of husbandry, on the Lords day; it is a manifeſt thing, that in his time, the Lords day was not kept for a Sabbath day, but rather as a light holy day: hereby it appeareth, that the patrones of the Lords day, haue little cauſe to glorie ſo much, in the law that Conſtantine made for the keeping of the Lords day holy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It appeareth by this, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made a law, for the keeping holy of <hi>Friday,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Sunday,</hi> both: the <hi>Friday,</hi> becauſe of Chriſt his paſſion, &amp; the <hi>Sunday</hi> or Lords day, becauſe of Chriſts reſurrection. For this ſee <hi>Euſeb: de vita Conſtant. lib. 4. Cap, 18.</hi> and ſee <hi>Sozom. lib. 1. Cap. 8.</hi> theſe ij dayes were inacted in one &amp; the ſame law, &amp; in one &amp; the ſame manner; whereby you ſee, that the Lords day vvas accounted in the primitiue
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:21140:148"/>Churches, no more an holy day, then <hi>Friday</hi> was an holy day; now I truſt no man will think, that the primitiue Churches, kept Friday for a Sabbath day: no nor yet that they kept both theſe as Sabbathes, the Friday, &amp; the Lords day; for ſo they ſhould haue kept ij or iij Sabbathes in a weeke. Thus you ſee their argument fetched from the practiſe of the primitiue Churches for the Lords day, will doe them no good.</p>

                     <p>Their third argument from Teſtimony, is the <hi>conſtant practiſe of the Church, for many hundreth of yeeres togeather:</hi> for (ſay they) the Church of God, hath kept this Lords day for a Sabbath, now this Sixtene hundreth yeeres, &amp; vpwards; &amp; can it be thought, that Gods Church ſhould laie in an errour ſo longe? what Sixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene hundreth yeeres?</p>
                     <p>Herevnto I anſwer, 1. that the Church of God hath not euer &amp; in all places kept the Lords day; for <hi>it was neglected of thos Churches, which ſucceeded the Apoſtles, vntill it was establiſhed by Chriſtian Emperours,</hi> ſo as in all porbability, it was not kept for 300 yeers by ſome Churches, as you haue heard quoted out of Perkins in the laſt Section before this.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In thoſe Churches where it was kept, it was not kept for a Sabbath, but as an holy day remiſly, and with workes of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry done in it; &amp; like as they kept their <hi>Friday,</hi> as we haue ſhowne in the former Section.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Since thoſe formoſt ages of the Church, it hath bene kept by all Chriſtian Churches being Romiſh, but as an other holy day, vntil <hi>Luther,</hi> and many yeeres ſince: for vntill Luther or thereabouts, our Church hath lyen buried in the Romiſh Church, as wheate in the chaffe; now it is vvell knowne, that the Church of Rome, doe hould &amp; maintaine the Lords day, to be but a <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church; and that it is to be kept but like an other holy day; &amp; not by the 4th com. (&amp; herein they are neerer the trueth then wee are) thus you ſee how the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth jumpe and agree vvith the Ancient Church in <hi>Conſtantins</hi> time; &amp; how both in Conſtantins time, and in the Church of Rome ſince, vntill Luthers time, the Lords day, hath
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:21140:149"/>beene accounted but as an holy day; the contrary whereto can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſhowne, thus you ſee what account the Churches haue made of the Lords day, vntill Luthers time, vvhich is a matter of fiften hundreth yeeres.</p>
                     <p>And now let vs come vnto the times ſince Luther: If we ſhall take a ſuruey of the Reformed Churches in France, &amp; the lovv Countries, it is apparant that they haue kept it remiſly, like an holy day, not like a Sabbath day; ſauing that, in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, at this time, it is more ſolemnly kept, much what as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly as we in England keepe it now; but they haue not kept it ſo ſolemnly, vntill now of late yeeres, as within this 7 or 10 yeeres, or thereaboutes, as is well knowne.</p>
                     <p>Come we then vnto our owne Church, which is the moſt famouſe Church for keeping of the Lords day of any other: I demaund how long our Church of England, hath kept this day, ſo zealouſly as now it doth? it is well knowne by men of yeeres, that can but remember 40 or 50 yeeres agone, that then the Lords day was not kept, as it is now: I ſpare to make a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, of the ordenary workes of mens caleings, then done on the Lords day, publikly, &amp; frequently; I cannot remember 40 yeers paſt, and yet in my time, I can remember ſuch ordenary workes done, generally of all ſortes of men, as are no Sabbath day workes I am ſuer; but for the particulars, I referr you to the memory of men of greater age &amp; more yeeres.</p>
                     <p>Thus I haue briefly giuen you a ſuruey, of the times &amp; ages of the Church, &amp; how the Lords day hath bene in account &amp; in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, from the Apoſtles times, vntill now with in theſe 40 or 50 yeeres, &amp; hitherto it hath not bene kept like a Sabbath day; how then can the patrons of the Lords day, boaſt that it bath bene kept as a Sabbath in the Churches, conſtantly, for Sixetene hundreth yeeres? &amp; whereas they aske by way of admiration, is it poſſible that the Church of God ſhould lye in an errour ſo long! what 1600 yeeres! they bewray their owne errour &amp; ignorance to ſpeake ſo; for I haue ſhowne, that the Church, neuer accounted it, or kept it for a Sabbath day but for an holy day, remiſly, for 1500 or 1600 yeeres together.</p>
                     <p>But admit that our Church, or ſome in our Church rather,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:21140:149"/>haue accounted the Lords day, for a Sabbath day, by the 4th com. for this 40 yeeres or 50 yeeres, make they ſuch a wonder, that a Church may lye in ſuch an errour, as this is, as if it were vnpoſſible? what will they then ſay vnto the Churches, that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Apoſtles, that neglected the Lords day all together for a matter of 300 yeeres, vntill it was reuiued by Chriſtian Emperours, as we haue formerly proued? why may not our Church, or ſome in our Church rather, err in thinking the Lords day, to be a Sabbath, when it is not: as well as thoſe Churches, which ſucceeded the Apoſtles, did err (as theſe men thinke that patronag the Lords day) in thinking the Lords day was not to be kept at all? if they might err for 300 yeeres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, may it not be thought poſſible for our new Sabbatha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians to err for 40 or 50 yeeres together? Beſids, it is not the Church of God, that hath erred ſo long; it is the errour only of our nevv Sabbatharians, who haue erred from their cradle, &amp; they thinke therfore that the whole Church of God hath alſo euer bene in errour with them, from the Apoſtles dayes, vntill now: indeed, they would faine make the world beleeue, that all Gods Church, hath euer bene of their minde for the Lords day, but you ſee they are foulely beguiled, thers no ſuch matter, it is but their dreame, when they awake they will ſee better.</p>
                     <p>It is to be lamented to ſee, how by this golding conceipt, that the Church of God hath euer conſtantly kept this Lords day for a Sabbath, ſince the Apoſtles, they haue ledd the world after them; and now they haue bred ſuch a firuent zeale of the Lords day, in the hearts of many men, as that they thinke it no leſſe then blaſphemy, for a man to ſay any thing againſt it, as they hold it.</p>
                     <p>But ſince they haue alleaged vnto vs the practiſe of the Church; I wiſh they would ſtand to their owne argument, and that they would ſubſcribe vnto it, that vve are no otherwiſe bound to the Lords day, then can be proued the primitiue Churches practiſedit: for then ſhould not all Churches be bound to keepe the Lords day; but ſome might keepe it, that pleaſed ſo to doe; and other Churches might omit the keeping of it, vvho pleaſed not to keepe it: for ſo vvas it in the primitiue
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:21140:150"/>Churches; ſome kept it, but otherſome kept it not, no not for 300 yeeres together, as vve haue proued in the Section before this: Then alſo, ſhould not thoſe Churches vvhich doe keepe it, keepe it as a Sabbath, but as an holy day, remiſly, ſo as they might make hay, in Hay ſeile; and reape their corne, in harueſt; and plough their Lands, in Wheate ſeile, vpon the Lords day, for ſo did the primitiue Churches in Conſtantins time, they did their vvorkes of husbandry on the Lords day. But ſome in our Church, are growne more ſtrict, then euer the primitiue Churches were, and yet theſe are holden the pureſt Churches, we muſt doe no worke in Hay-ſeile, Barley-ſeile, Harueſt, nor Wheate-ſeile, &amp; all in conſcience of the 4th com. if vve ſhould imitate the primitiue Churches in theſe dayes, either by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Lords day altogether, as ſome of them did; or by doeing the vvorkes of huſ bandry on the Lords day, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of them did, theſe our Miniſters, who vſe more zeale then knowledge, would damne vs to the pit of hell for it.</p>
                     <p>To conclud this Section, vvhereas Miniſters haue formerly &amp; frequently, abuſed the Churches of God deceaſed, &amp; ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them, by fathering this their errour vpon them, as if they had bene of their minds, keeping the Lords day for a Sabbath, vvhich is falſe as you ſee: hereby they haue vvronged the dead, yea, thoſe pure primitiue Churches of God, &amp; made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeake vvhat they neuer thought, to the boulſtering vp of a late ſprung vp errour; an errour of 40 or 50 yeeres old, by ſome in our Church; &amp; of 7 or 10 yeers old, in ſome other Churches: they muſt conſider alſo hovv many thowſand ſoules they haue ſeduced, partly by this golding tale, of the conſtant practiſe of all Churches; and for time to come let theſe things be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that ſo thoſe primitiue Churches be no more abuſed, nor our Chriſtian auditours deluded.</p>

                        <p>My firſt Teſtimony, ſhall be that recorded by <hi>M. Perkines</hi> on the 4th com. in his firſt volume, in the order of the Cauſes of Salvation and Damnation pag. 48. which before I touched vpon, where caleing the Lords day by the name of Sabbath, he thus writeth: <hi>The obſervation of the Sabbath, was neglected of thoſe Churches, which ſucceeded the Apostles, but after wards was eſtabliſhed by Christian Emperours, as a day most apte to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the memorie of the Redemption.</hi> And for this, he quoteth his Author, <hi>Leo and Anton. Edict. of holie daies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here it is to be noted 1. that this Teſtimony, is not of what ſome priuate perſones did, or thought of the Lords day, but what was done by an wholl Church; yea by Churches, in the plurall number. 2. The thing recorded of theſe Churches is, that they neglected the obſervation and ſanctification of the Lords day Sabbath. 3. The time is to be noted, how longe they continued, without obſeruation of the day; and this is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be about Three hundreth yeeres: for it is ſaid, it was neglected vntill it was eſtabliſhed by Chriſtian Emperours: now it is well knowne, that the firſt Chriſtian Emperour, that made any Decree for the honourable &amp; Religiouſe obſervation of the Lords day, was <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who liued about 300 yeeres after Chriſt. 4. The laſt thing remarkable, is to conſider what Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es theſe were which ſo neglected the Lords day; they were not any of thoſe later Churches, who were corrupted, with the dregges of popery; but they were the moſt ancient the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches, and ſo the moſt pure Churches.

Why, the 4th com. directly forbiddeth all ſeruile labours, ſuch as are ploughing, carteing, ſowing, ſetting and the like; they could not be ſo voide of reaſon therefore, as to giue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, yea, and that <hi>freely,</hi> to doe ſeruile vvorkes, and laboriouſe on the Lords day, if the Lords day had in their iudgment, ſtoode by virtue of the 4th Com. as many now a dayes faine it.</p>
                        <p>We heare now a dayes, much ſownd of that famouſe Decree, of <hi>Constantine,</hi> made for the ſanctification of the Lords day: but, behold vvhat it was, hee required none other ſanctification of it, then we now a dayes, make of our common Holy dayes, <hi>S.

                        <p>An other Teſtimony is a Decree of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> recorded by <hi>Euſebius de vita Constant.</hi> lib. 4. cap. 18. and alſo by <hi>Sozom.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 8. vvherein hee decreed by one &amp; the ſame law, without any difference making, that all his Empire, ſhould ſanctifie both the <hi>Friday,</hi> and the <hi>Sunday;</hi> the day before the Iewes Sabbath, &amp; the day after it; The Sunday, becauſe of Chriſt his <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> The Friday, becauſe of Chriſt his <hi>Paſſion.</hi> Loe here then were two dayes in a weeke ſanctified, the Friday &amp; the Sunday, and that without difference: Now who that readeth this, can thinke that the Church in Conſtantins time, kept the Sunday or Lords day as a Sabbath, vnleſſe he ſhould abſurdly thinke, that they kept two Sabbaths in a weeke, the Friday &amp; the Sunday? it is more likely, that they kept them both but as we keepe ſome light holy dayes. Nor did the memory of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> exalte the Lords day any higher, then did the memory of the <hi>Paſſion</hi> exalte the Friday.

                        <p>My fowrth Teſtimony, ſhall be the iudgment of <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine;</hi> who in his 118 Epiſtle <hi>de feſtis diebus</hi> thus writeth; <hi>But as for thoſe things which we obſerue, by Tradition, &amp; not by wrighting, we vnderſtand them to be giuen, either by the Apoſtles themſelues, or by approued Councells &amp;c. As the anniuerſary celebration of the Lords Paſſion, the Reſurrection, &amp; the Aſcention &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In vvhich paſſage, vve note theſe particulars. 1. That <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> accounted the Sanctification of the Lords day, to be a thing receiued by <hi>Tradition.</hi> 2. That its inſtitution, was not to be founde in the Scriptures: for he ſaith, <hi>which we obſerue by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not by wrighting &amp;c.</hi> 3. That <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> was doubtfull &amp; vncertaine, vvhither the obſeruation of the Lords day, vvere a Tradition receiued from the Apoſtles, or from Councells. 4. That <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> rekoneth the Lords day, being the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> to be of no better, nor higher authority, then are <hi>Good Friday,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hallow Thurſday,</hi> the Feaſts of Chriſts Paſſion &amp; Aſcention. We may as well therefore, by S. Auguſtins iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſanctify euery Friday, and euery Thurſday for Sabbaths throughout the yeere, as euery Lords day: for they haue all three the ſame originall, &amp; ſelfeſame grownd &amp; Authority: for, they be all Traditions, &amp; vnwritten Traditions, and doubtfull, whither from the Apoſtles or from Councells.</p>
                        <p>By the way, ſince S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> knew no Scripture; for the ſanctification of the Lords day for the Sabbath, how cometh it about, I maruaile, that many in our dayes, haue found out ſo many Scriptures for it? vve haue now this text of Scripture Ioh. 20.19.26. witneſſing, that Chriſt did often appeare vnto his Diſciples on this day. Another Text we haue for it Act. 20.7. where S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached a ſermon at <hi>Troas</hi> on this day. An other Text we haue found out 1. Cor. 16.2. vvhere there was a
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:21140:152"/>collection for the poore on this day. And yet an other Text we haue Reuel. 1.10. where this day is called the <hi>Lords day.</hi> I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile S. Auguſtine, and his times, ſhould be ſo ignorant, as not to ſee theſe textes, as warrantable inſtitutions for the Lords day, to become a Sabbath, ſince wee ſee them, and ſay they are ſo cleere to proue the point. Shall I tell you mine opinion? it is this; I ſuppoſe, they that firſt ſet their witts on worke, to finde a Diuine inſtitution for this Lords day, they ſawe nothing but Tradition of the Church for it, as for the reſt of Holy dayes; but miſeliking this, they iudged it better, to haue it ſtand by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ordinance; and therefore, haue vſed their witts, to wreſt theſe Scriptures thitherwards; ſo now, they haue fathered the matter all vpon God: and made this Lords day a Diuine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to get the more honour vnto it: this durſt not S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> doe; but he more ingenuouſly, plainly confeſſed it to be, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed &amp; in trueth it is, A Tradition of the Church, &amp; of equall authority, for its ſanctification, with <hi>Good Friday, Hallow Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> &amp; other <hi>Holie daies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To conclude, well we may make of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> what eſteme we vvill; but yet you ſee, it is but a Tradition, (a Popiſh Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) &amp; as this vvas the Iudgement of S. Auguſtine, ſo you ſhall ſee it confirmed by others alſo by &amp; by. Now if it proue but a Tradition them may vve conclud, that all Romiſh rubiſh, is not as yet cleane ſwept out of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches.</p>
                        <p>An other Teſtimony of <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> I finde in his vvorkes <hi>contra Adimant: cap. 16.</hi> vvhere he thus vvriteth; <hi>For we alſo doe celebrate both the Lords day, &amp; the Feaſt of Eaſter, &amp; certaine other feſtiuall daies: but we obſerue not the times, but onelie the things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by or in thoſe times &amp;c.</hi> Loe here, S. Auguſtine ſaith, they kept the Lords day indede in his time, &amp; in that Church: but how? they kept it much like as they kept other Holy dayes, and feſtiualls: for ſaith he, <hi>non tempora obſervamus,</hi> we regard not the times &amp;c. I, but did the Lords day, ſtand by the ordinance of Chriſt, then S. Auguſtine would haue regarded the time: for he muſt haue regarded that very day, if Chriſt had ordained it: &amp; did the Lords day, ſtand by virtue of the 4th Com. then S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine muſt haue obſerued the time: for the day &amp; time, to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:21140:153"/>wit, the Seauenth day, vvas no leſſe inioyned in the 4th Com. then reſt from laboures, &amp; holy excerciſes: how can men that worke on the Lords day Sabbath, be ſaid to rob God of his time, if the time be not to be regarded? it is more then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt therfore, that S. Auguſtine, &amp; the Church of God in his time did not beleeue it, that the Lords day, vvas inſtituted by Chriſt; or that it was to be ſanctified by virtue of the 4th Com. I could alleage other. Teſtimonies out of S. Auguſtine, to the ſame effect, but theſe are ſufficient.</p>

                        <p>Soe much for the iudgement of the Auncients, &amp; the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Churches, for the firſt 400 yeeres &amp; vpwards: I come now vnto our later times. My 5th Teſtimony then, ſhall be that of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> cited by <hi>Marlorate</hi> in his Commentaryon, 1 Cor. 16.2. who thus writeth, <hi>Like as the Sabbath day, was celebrated by the Law, in memory of the Creation; ſo is now the Lords day in vſe, in memory of the Reſurrection: but when this chang &amp; altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made, we haue it not expreſsed in the Scriptures:</hi> and then againe, a little beneath ſaith he; <hi>Neither are we therefore to be accuſed as obſeruers of dayes &amp; times, as if we placed more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in one day then in an other: for we aſsemble, rather on the Lords day then on any other day, onely for ciuill reſpectes, &amp; for the order of the Church.</hi> It is plaine then, that this Holy man accounted the Lords day, to be an ordinance of the Church onely, and a <hi>ciuill</hi> thing, &amp; kept onely for order ſake: he knew of no Diuine inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for it, nor of any 4th com. belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging vnto it; nor thought he that there was any difference to be made, betvvene the Lords day, &amp; other dayes of the vveeke, in any reſpect vnto Chriſts inſtitution of it: for he ſaieth expreſly, that it is not found in the Scriptures vvhen the Lords day vvas ſet vp: how then vvill men doe to proue, the Lords day, to be of Diuine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

                        <p>My 7th Teſtimony, ſhall be that of <hi>Caluine</hi> on Galat. 4.10. where he thus writeth, <hi>When wee now a daies obſerue a difference of daies, we doe not put any bonde or tie, of neceſſitie vpon mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; we make no difference of daies, as if one day were more holie then an other, we place no religion in them; but we onely prouide for order &amp; concorde</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p> To mende the matter, happily ſome vvill ſay, that howbeit M. Perkins doth graunt, it was the common opinion, ſo to thinke of the change, yet he addeth, that it is more conſonant to the New Teſtament, to hold, that Chriſt himſelfe changed it; &amp; ſo that Chriſt was the Author of this Lords day. I grant indeed he ſaith ſo, and indeauoreth to proue it to be ſo, &amp; that by iij Textes of Scripture; but then the queſtion ſhall be, whither M. Perkins iudged, that it cold be proued by theſe Textes, to be a neceſſary, &amp; vndoubted trueth, or but a contingent &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable thing: Now that he held &amp; was of opinion, that it was but a probable trueth, and ſomwhat likely onely, himſelfe elſe where ſhall expound himſelfe: for this purpoſe, ſee his <hi>Caſes of Conſcience,</hi> and ſecond Volume pag. 106. vvhere the holy man, ſpeaking to the conſcience, of this new Sabbath, durſt not ſpeake pere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptorily, as of a thing certainly &amp; infalliblie true, but tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly as it were, repeating ouer his doubtfull ſpeeches, three or fowre times, in 6 or 8 lines writing: theſe are his words; <hi>The Sabbath day in the new Testament (in all likelihood) is tied to that we cale the Lords day; &amp; that (as I take it) by Christ himſelfe. The reaſons thereof are theſe,</hi> 1. <hi>the Sabbath of the new Testament is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lords day, Reuel. 1.10. now J ſuppoſe (for in theſe points ſtill wee must goe by likelihoods) it is called the Lords day, as Chriſts laſt Supper, is called the Lords Supper</hi> &amp;c. And then his ſecond reaſon is taken out of 1. Cor. 16.2. and his third out of Ioh. 20.19. Now in prouing the Lords day, to be the Sabbath; he vttereth theſe doubtfull ſpeeches in theſe fewe lines, 1. in all likelyhood. 2. As I take it. 3. I ſuppoſe. 4. For in theſe points, we muſt ſtill goe by likelyhoods. Surely, had there bene any ſound and prouing arguments, to be fetched out of theſe iij Textes Reuel. 1.10. 1. Cor. 16.2. &amp; Ioh. 20.19.26. M.

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:21140:156"/>when he had made the moſt, and beſt of it that he could, is but a probable thing, a mere likelihood, vncertaine whither euer Chriſt inſtituted it or not; now tell me is it meete, that Chriſtian people, ſhold be preſſed in ſermones, to ſanctify this Lords day, &amp; that vpon <hi>certaine</hi> paine of damnation if they faile; when it is <hi>vncertaine</hi> whither it be of Chriſts inſtitution or not? iudge of the matter good reader.</p>
                        <p>To conclud, how euer, this is plainly yeelded by M. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kines, that if we will borrow light from the Hiſtories of the Church, it is the <hi>common</hi> opinion of ſuch as are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, that the old Sabbath was noe throwne downe, nor the Lords day Sabbath ſet vp, vntill long after Chriſts aſcention, vntill a matter of 300 yeeres after Chriſt. And ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the teſtimony of M. Perkins.</p>

How be it, becauſe it was neceſſarie, that a day ſhould be reſerued in the which the people might come together, to heare the word of God, they ordained, in ſteade of the Sabbath, which was Saturday, the next day following, which is Sunday. And all though they might haue kept the Saturday, with the Iewes, as a thing indifferent, yet did they much better to ouerſett the day, to be a perpetuall memorie, that we are free, &amp; not bound to any day: we are in a manner as ſuperſtitiouſe in the Sunday, as they
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:21140:158"/>were in the Saturday: yea, and wee are much more madd: for the Iewes haue the word of God, for their Saturday, ſith it is the 7th day, &amp; they were commanded to keepe the 7th day ſolemne: &amp; wee, haue not the word of God, for vs; but rather againſt vs: for wee keepe not the 7th day, as the Iewes doe, but the firſt day, which is not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Gods law.</hi> And by &amp; by againe he addeth. <hi>He that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that a man ſinneth, which worketh on the Holy day, if he be weake or ignorant, he ought better to be inſtructed, &amp; ſo to leaue his hould.

                     <p>Firſt touching the <hi>Admonition;</hi> by the whole diſcourſe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords day, already finiſhed, thou maieſt ſee Chriſtian reader, that there is no footeing or grownd in the word of God, to make the Lords day a Sabbath: wherefore I doe hereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, both Miniſters and people, and deſire them to take knowledge of it henceforth, that this their zealouſe ſanctifying of the Lords day, in conſcience of the 4th com. &amp; of Chriſt his inſtitution, it is no better before God, &amp; with wiſemen then <hi>Superstition,</hi> and <hi>needleſſe</hi> religion: for when men will doe that in Gods ſeruice, &amp; in obedience vnto God, the which hee hath no where commanded them, what is this but a needleſſe religion
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:21140:160"/>and ſuperſtition? when men cannot ſhew Gods will for that they doe, then it muſt follow that it is of their owne <hi>willes,</hi> &amp; ſo their religion in that point is a voluntary-religion, and a <hi>will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> Let me not be miſtaken, the Lords day may be conſidered as an ordinance of God, or as an ordinance of man: as it is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly conceiued to be an ordinance of God, in this ſenſe only I ſpeake againſt it; but as it is an ordinance of man, that is, as it is commanded by the Magiſtrate, &amp; ſo at his will and pleſure, to continue it or diſcontinue it, in this regard I haue nothing againſt it: ſo much for the Admonition.</p>
                     <p>I come now vnto the <hi>Debortation:</hi> my firſt reaſon diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, is becauſe we hate Superſtition &amp; will-worſhip in others: how doe we beare againſt our aduerſaries the Papiſtes, becauſe of their ſuperſtitiouſe Traditiones, and Religion of will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip! and can we ſee an errour in them, and cannot we ſee the ſame errour in our ſelues! had we bene wiſe for our ſelues, we might haue ſeene this errour long agone; for they haue often admoniſhed vs in their writings againſt vs, telling vs, that our Lords day is but a <hi>Tradition</hi> from the fathers, and a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church; &amp; herein (giue the deuill his right, as they ſay) they haue ſpoken moſt truly, albeit we haue giuen deafe care vnto them, &amp; laboured to ſhifte it of: and will we conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mne them for will-worſhip, &amp; ſuperſtition, &amp; practiſe the ſame our ſelues? well, heare what S. Paul ſaith, <hi>therefore thou art inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, O man, whoſoeuer thou art that condemneſt: for in that that thou condemneſt an other, thou condemneſt thy ſelfe: for thou that condemnest, doest the ſame thinges</hi> Rom. 2.1. Many Miniſters, thinke them ſelues farr enough of, from ſuperſtition &amp; <hi>will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> whilſt in the pulpit, they can cry out againſt the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Papiſts, when as indeed and in trueth, themſelues are euen then, very Papiſtes in this point, &amp; greate patrones and maintainers of ſuperſtition &amp; will worſhip: wherefore, let them reforme themſelues or elſe let them be ſilent touching Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, you haue ſeene it proued by good Authority, that the Lords day is but a Tradition of the Church, &amp; ſhall we retaine Popiſh Traditiones? will theſe Miniſters be ſtill patrones, and ſupporters, of vnwritten Traditiones? I would hope better of them.</p>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:21140:160"/>
                     <p> My ſecond reaſon diſſwaſiue, is becauſe we ſhall all <hi>leeſe our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> in the Sanctification of the Lords day; vve ſhall labour in vaine: For, if we like ſeruants, will be doeing of ſuch vvorkes, as our Maiſter neuer appointed vs, doe vve thinke our Maiſter vvill thanke vs, yea &amp; reward vs for them? you haue heard, that <hi>God</hi> neuer commanded vs, to ſanctify the Lords day, by the 4th Com. &amp; that Chriſt neuer appointed it, in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if therefore we will be hallowing of the Lords day, thinke you that <hi>God</hi> will reward you for it, or that <hi>Chriſt</hi> vvill thanke you for it? many men that are honeſtly diſpoſed, &amp; of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſe minds, being miſled by ſome Miniſters, they leeſe ſome yeeres their Hay in the field; ſome yeers their corne in the field, &amp; all of conſcience, thinking it a duety for them ſo to doe, rather then to labour on the Lords day: &amp; many others, keepe the Lords day very ſtrictly, both priuatly &amp; publikly, erroniouſly miſperſwaded, that that text, Iſa. 58.13. inioyneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo to doe: but is not all this Labour in vaine? God neuer commanded it, Chriſt neuer appointed it, neither will God, or Chriſt euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it: nay, God may anſwer them thus, <hi>who required this at your hands?</hi> Iſai. 1.12.</p>
                     <p>My third reaſon diſſwaſiue, is becauſe God hath manifeſted his diſlike of ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in many paſſages of his Holy word: ſee Deut. 12.32. <hi>Whatſoeuer I command you, take heede you doe it: thou ſhalt put nothing thereto, nor take ought therefrom.</hi> Here you ſee, that God will haue nothing added to his worſhip &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: <hi>Thou ſhalt put nothing thereto;</hi> ſaith the Text: but now the Patrones of this Lords day, haue put ſome thing thereto: for they haue <hi>put</hi> the Lords day, vnto the 4th Com. of God: a moſt dangerouſe &amp; preſumptuouſe attempt, &amp; ſuch as they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer anſwer before God; nay they cannot iuſtifie it before men, by good argument; how then ſhall they be able to ſtand before God? think they to <hi>add</hi> an other day, to Gods Com. and iuſtifie it before God, by ſuch their friuolouſe conſequences, as they vainly pretend to be neceſſary conſequences? let Miniſters thinke of this &amp; that ſeriouſly too, &amp; let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe it in time alſo.</p>
                     <p>In the New Teſtament God hath reucaled himſelfe this way alſo, <hi>If any man ſhall adde vnto theſe things, God ſhall adde vnto
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:21140:161"/>him the plagues that are written in this booke,</hi> Reuel. 22.18. If Chriſt vvas ſo carefull, that nothing be added to this parte of his will wrote by S. Iohn in his Reuelation, no doubt he hath the ſame care, of all partes of his will in the New Teſtament; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let our Miniſters that are Patrones of our new Sabbath, thinke of this Text alſo; for when they ſay &amp; teach the people, that Chriſt inſtituted &amp; appointed the Lords day (which is falſe; for Chriſt neuer inſtituted it, as appeareth by my anſwer vnto all their arguments) in ſo teaching the people, they doe add vnto the New Teſtament &amp; they add vnto Chriſt his inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones, a day which Chriſt neuer inſtituted: thus they haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto Chriſt his ordinances of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> they hau added vnto theſe I ſay an other ordinance, that is none of Chriſts, which is the <hi>Lords day:</hi> now let them heare their doome without repentance; <hi>God ſhall add vnto them the plagues that are written in this booke,</hi> of the Reuelation: and one plague I ſinde there written, which is a plague of plagues, it is hell fyer, <hi>to haue a parte in the lake, that burneth with fyer &amp; brimſtone, which is the ſecond death,</hi> Reuel. 21.8. I know they ſleite &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne mee, &amp; think if they can ſo carry it with the people, as they may but ſaue their credits with them a while, they hope to quench mee for euer, I being but one, and ſuch a vile one in their eyes: wherefore I haue taken vnto me more helpe, now I haue God on my ſide &amp; Chriſt on my ſide, &amp; they ſhall defend me againſt theſe men; and theſe men muſt know it now, or ſhall will they nill they hereafter, that they diſpiſed not me, but God &amp; Chriſt; and that now they haue met t with their Maſter, God will deale with them, &amp; if they will be adding vnto God, God will adde vnto them.</p>
                     <p>You haue an other Text alſo Numb. 15.39. <hi>that ye may Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member all the Commandements of the Lord, &amp; doe them: &amp; that yee ſeeke not after your owne heart, nor after your owne eyes, after the which ye goe a whoring.</hi> Where we ſee, how God deteſteth to haue mens deuices, brought into his worſhip; he calleth it a <hi>whoriſh tricke:</hi> to hould the Lords day, to be commanded by God, or inſtituted by Chriſt, when it cannot be proued, it is to goe a <hi>whoring</hi> after their owne heart, &amp; after their owne eyes.</p>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:21140:161"/>
                     <p> An other Text you haue Mark. 7.7.8. <hi>But they worſhip me in vaine, teaching for doctrines the commandements of men: for ye lay the commandement of God a parte, &amp; obſerue the Tradition of men:</hi> a like Text you haue Iſa. 29.13.14.15. where a <hi>woe</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced vpon the people, whoſe feare towards God, was taught by the precepts of men. <hi>And their feare towards mee was taught by the precepts of men.</hi> Whereas the former Text ſaith, yee ſay the commandement of God aparte: how true this is of theſe 10 Miniſters forenamed, who reiect as Iewiſh &amp; Ceremoniall, the Lords Sabbath, expreſly commanded in the Morall Law; let all men iudge: for doe they not lay this <hi>Commandement</hi> of God a parte, which inioyneth moſt directly the 7th day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath? this by the way; but the words that belong vnto our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are theſe, <hi>teaching for doctrines the commandements of men.</hi> The Lords day Sabbath, it is a doctrine taught frequently and bouldly; but it is no commandement of Gods; and therfore it muſt be onely a Commandement of men. The next words for our preſent occation, are theſe; <hi>and obſerue the Tradition of men.</hi> That the Lords day is a <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church, not onely Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts auowch it: but alſo diuerſe of thoſe Authores which I haue cited againſt the Lords day, doe expreſly affirme it, that the Lords day is but a Tradition: and all of them ſay, that it is but an ordinance of <hi>men,</hi> and a Commandement of <hi>man,</hi> yea ſo much the wholl <hi>Church</hi> confeſſed in the dayes of <hi>K. Edward.</hi> ſo then in kepeing it, &amp; in preaching for it, you keepe the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of men, &amp; preach for A Tradition of man: And ſo alſo, they that are afraide to tranſgreſſe the Lords day, &amp; to worke in it, this their <hi>feare</hi> toward God; it is <hi>taught by the precepts of men;</hi> for God hath left no precept for the Lords day, the breach whereof we neede be afraide of. Heare then the doome, that belongeth vnto ſuch needleſſe religion, all this their worſhip it is a vaine thing, <hi>In vaine doe they worſhip mee &amp;c.</hi> Yea, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth a woe vnto ſuch worſhip, &amp; this is the reward of it, <hi>woe vnto them &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 29.15.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Text that I will mention, is Colo. 2.23. <hi>which things haue indeed a ſhewe of wiſedome, in voluntary Religion; or in will-worſhip,</hi> Iudge now good reader, if I doe them any wronge, to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:21140:162"/>rekone the Lords day, as a limme of this voluntary Religion, &amp; as a branch of will-worſhip: for if they cannot ſhew vs where God hath commaunded it, then it is a voluntary thing, and of mans owne will; and therfore may be called a voluntary Religion, &amp; a will-worſhip: happely there may be, in the eyes of ſuch as haue bene nuſled vp from the cradle, in this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſe practiſe, <hi>a ſhewe of wiſedome</hi> in it, as the Text ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: But if S. Paul may be iudge, <hi>they are things of no value</hi> as he ſpeaketh in the ſame Text. Wherefore ſince God hath in all theſe Textes of Scripture, manifeſted his diſlike of Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let this be enough, to diſſwad euery man from the practiſe of it: And that ſo much the rather, becauſe the vphoulding of this day, is the iuſling &amp; ſhouldering out, of the Lords <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> mentioned in the 4th Com. ſo as the words of our bleſſed Sauiour, are true againſt them, ſaying, <hi>well ye reiect the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, that ye may obſerue your owne Tradition,</hi> Mark. 7.9. For, they trample downe the Lords <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> that they may keepe their owne <hi>Lords day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My 4th reaſon diſſwaſiue, is becauſe by the vphoulding of this Lords day Sabbath, the ſacred Scriptures, &amp; vvord of God is profaned: I make that appeare thus; Miniſters doe daily vrge the 4th Com. vpon the Lords day; &amp; doe preſſe mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Sanctifying of the Lords day, by the 4th Comm. now the 4th Com. doth ſpeake (as he that hath but halfe an eye may ſee) of the day called Sabbath day, but this, is a day called Lords day: the 4th Com. was made for a ſanctified &amp; hallowed day: for God himſelfe bleſſed it, &amp; <hi>ſanctified</hi> it, Geneſ. 2.3. but this Lords day, is a profane day, a common day, neuer <hi>ſanctified</hi> by God; but on the contrary appointed for labour, it being one of the ſixe working dayes, mentioned in the 4th Com. &amp; Chriſt himſelfe trauailing on it &amp;c. Now for Miniſters, to apply this ſacred word of Gods 4th Com. vnto a profane, common, and vnſanctified day &amp; time; this, or nothing, is to profane the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred word of God. Secondly, many portions of Scripture in the New Teſtament; with ſome alſo out of the old, are hereby alſo wreſted, abuſed, &amp; profaned: the Spirit of God, is made to ſpeake for that, which neuer came into his minde to thinke; a
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:21140:162"/>moſt horrible &amp; vnſufferable thing in a Chriſtian Church: as for example theſe Texts, Pſal. 118.24. Ioh. 20.1.19.26. Act. 1.2.3. Act. 2.1.14 &amp;c. Act. 20.7.1 Cor. 16.2. 2. Cor. 5.17. and Reuel. 1.10. theſe eight Textes at leaſt, beſids the 4th Com. are abuſed for the maintenance of a forged, new coined, and counterfait Sabbath day: who that hath any zeale of Gods glory, or loue vnto his Holy word, can endure it, that Gods word and trueth ſhould be thus profanly vſed, profaned, &amp; abuſed? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you beare any reuerence vnto the ſacred word of God, let a reformation be made.</p>
                     <p>Looke vpon the third Com. <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine:</hi> now Gods word, is a parte of his name, wherby he is knowne Act. 9.15. therfore for men to abuſe &amp; profane Gods word, it is to abuſe &amp; profane Gods name, &amp; ſo a ſinne againſt the third Com. now the reward of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation, is this, that <hi>God will not hold him guiltleſſe, that taketh his name in vaine:</hi> hee ſhall ſurely therfore be puniſhed, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance &amp; amendement. But vvhat doe I ſpeaking to deafe Adders, men will not be charmed; what they haue holden they will hold; as for me, I am but one &amp; meane, they are many &amp; mighty: ſo that I almoſt deſpaire of remedy: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer I haue diſcouered their ſinne vnto them, at their perill be it, whither they will amend it or not. I abhorre to thinke of it, yet this I am ſure of, that that is true amongſt vs, which the Lord once complained of by his Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> that is, <hi>that an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible &amp; filthy thingis committed in the land: the Prophets prphecy lies; &amp; people delight therein,</hi> Ierem. 5.30.31. that the Prophets prophecy lyes, this is apparent as hath bene ſhowne: and the people delight therein: this is manifeſt, in aſmuch as many that are both religiouſe &amp; alſo counted wiſe, are not aſhamed to ſpeake it, that they wiſh from their hearts, that I had neuer medled in this point; ſo we haue for the moſt parte, like Prieſt, like people, both delighting in this counterfait Sabbath; &amp; both like vnto Nadab &amp; Abihu, who <hi>offered ſtraung fier before the Lord, which hee had not commaunded them,</hi> Leuit. 10.1.</p>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:21140:163"/>
                     <p> My 5th and laſt reaſon diſſwaſiue is, becauſe it is a <hi>ſinne</hi> for Miniſters to preach for the Lords day. This I proue, becauſe they cannot ſpeake for it in faith: now <hi>whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle Rom. 14.23. now that they cannot preach for it in faith, is plaine by this, that they haue no word of God, for the grownd of their faith: &amp; we haue alredy ſhowne, that they haue no word of God for this Lords day Sabbath: for they can not ſhew vs, where Chriſt, or any of his Apoſtles, left any commandement for it: no, nor yet haue they any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequences for it; ſo often therefore, as A Miniſter preſſeth the people to ſanctify the Lords day Sabbath, ſo often he ſinneth. And ſo much touching this Lords day Sabbath.</p>

                     <p>IN the firſt place, let me diſcouer an high point of folly in theſe Antiſabbatharians: for a ſeruant to forſake his old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, before he knows where to haue a new; or for any man to pull downe his old houſe, before he had found for certaine, that he was able to build vp a new houſe, is a greate folly: into this folly are falne, not onely thoſe other 9 Miniſters, by caling the Lords Sabbaths Ceremonies, Iewiſh, &amp; Iudaiſme, to bring them into reproch; but eſpecially M.

I wiſh all men to learne wiſedome by their folly, that is, neuer to debaſe &amp; ſtriue to aboliſh the old Sabbath, vntill they know how to proue the Lords day to be a Sabbath, &amp; ſo to ſet vp a new Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>That with the moreculler and ſhew of trueth, men might aboliſh Gods Sabbathes, beſides their loading of them with reprochfull termes, of <hi>Iudaiſme,</hi> and aboliſhed <hi>Shaddowes,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and the like, they haue alſo taken in hand to make one of Gods Tenn commandements, namly the 4th com. to be <hi>partly</hi> Morall &amp; <hi>partly</hi> Ceremoniall: a thing at the firſt hearing, very ſtraung, and moſt abſurd: the abſurdneſſe whereof, in the firſt place I will indeauour to ſet before your eyes, &amp; then come to ſhew you their reaſones, &amp; anſwer them one by one.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid by Moſes that <hi>God ſpake all theſe words</hi> Exod. 20.1. and this is equally praefixed to all the 10 commandements: and God wrote <hi>them all</hi> in Tables of ſtone together: now can it be thought, that of all theſe 10. onely one ſhould ſo farr differ
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:21140:164"/>from all its fellowes, as when they are intirly Morall, hauing no title of Ceremony in them; this one ſhould be <hi>halfe</hi> Morall, <hi>halfe</hi> Ceremoniall; or partly morall, partly Ceremoniall? did not God write as well, <hi>all</hi> the whole 4th com. in Tables of ſtone, as ſome parte of it? and did not God as well ſpeake <hi>all</hi> the 4th com. euen that parte of it which they would haue a ceremony, as all the other commandements? why then ſhould men make a difference, where God made none?</p>
                     <p>It can neuer be ſhowne, that God wrote any <hi>ſhaddow,</hi> or <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie</hi> in his Tables of ſtone: for, no ceremonies euer came with in the compaſſe of that pale or bedge: nor can it be ſhowne, that <hi>God</hi> did ſo farr honour any ceremony, as to deliuer it &amp; ſpeake it, from his owne mouth: <hi>God</hi> ſpake all theſe words; that is, all theſe 10 Moralles, but God ſpake none of the ceremonies; for <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake theſe; God appointed Moſes to deliuer the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall lawes; this difference you may reade of, made by God Exod. 20.1.22.24. Exod. 21.1. Deut. 5.2.4.6.22.31. and is not this abſurd, that men ſhould fanſy a ceremony to be in the 4th com. when they cannot ſhew the like, in any of the other nine commandements? nor that euer God ſo farr honoured any cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as to deliuer it by his owne voice, and write it with his owne finger in Tables of ſtone?</p>
                     <p>An other abſurdety: who could imagine, that of Tenn com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, all purly morall, all to laſt <hi>perpetuallie</hi> to the worlds end, &amp; all appertaining vnto <hi>all Nations</hi> Iewes &amp; Gentiles, ſaue onely one of the tenn? and this one commandement, muſt needs be of a contrary nature vnto all its fellowes, the other 9 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; for this muſt be mixedly morall; a parte of it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and an other parte of it ceremoniall: a parte of it to laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to the worlds end; and a parte of it to be faded &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed away ſixtene hundreth yeeres agone; a parte of it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto all nations Iewes and Gentiles both, and an other part of it to belong vnto the ſole Nation of the Iewes onely: who can thinke that God would yoke &amp; couple ſuch vnequall things together? yea, who could imagine, that there ſhould be a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall ordinance, in the body of the 4th com.? and in the heart of the Morall law? a man may as well fanſy darkeneſſe, to be in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:21140:164"/>the body of the Sunne, as a ſhaddow in the heart of the morall law.</p>
                     <p>Diuines vſe to reſemble theſe 10 commandements, vnto a goolding chaine, conſiſting of 10 linkes, &amp; of ſuch an vnity and combined nature as he that draweth one, draweth all, which is a very trueth indeed: but theſe now who ſet themſelues againſt the Lords Sabbathes, they faine one of theſe 10 linkes, to be made of a mettall differing from all the reſt; for wheras the chaine of 10 linkes is called a goolding chaine, they neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe will haue one of theſe 10 linkes to be partly gold, &amp; partly leade: ſo then to ſpeake properly, they muſt here after count the 10 com. to be a <hi>goolden-leaden</hi> chaine &amp;c: &amp; whereas they vſe to cale theſe 10 com. the morall law, now to ſpeake properly, they muſt cale it the <hi>Morall-Ceremoniall</hi> law; for they make Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony in it; this is as if the Snow, which hitherto we haue ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led white ſnow, we ſhould hereafter cale it white-blacke ſnowe: thus you ſee by comparing this 4th com. with its fellowes, how abſurd they are, that will attempt to make ſomthing in the 4th com. a Ceremony;</p>
                     <p>I add herevnto this abſurdety alſo, that theſe men muſt deny the integrity &amp; <hi>perfection</hi> of the law; and hould a lamed, broken, and imperfect law, &amp; ſo ſerue God by halues &amp; by peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale; or elſe, they cannot diſpute againſt the 7th day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, contained in the morall law: for take that away, and the law is not an <hi>intire</hi> &amp; <hi>perfect</hi> law, but a maimed and lamed thing.</p>
                     <p>An other abſurdety I charge them with, and that is horrible <hi>partiality:</hi> for they can find anſwers &amp; diſtinctions, to preſerue the Morall Law, from being aboliſhed by <hi>Libertines</hi> &amp; <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> ſaying, it is aboliſhed for <hi>Justification,</hi> but in force ſtill, for <hi>obſeruation:</hi> &amp; yet will neither find, &amp; I doubt, nor receiue any anſwer or diſtinction, that may preſerue the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> which is a parte of that Law: &amp; is not this partiality, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend one parte of Gods Law, &amp; not an other? yea, I dare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowch it, that Anabaptiſts, Libertins, and Antinomians, doe bring euery way, as able prouing ſcriptures againſt the wholl Law, as <hi>Anti Sabbatharians</hi> doe, againſt this parte of Gods Law
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:21140:165"/>which concerneth his 7th day Sabbath: ſee theſe againſt the whole Law Epheſ. 2.15. Hebr. 7.12. Rom. 6.14. 1. Tim. 1.9. 2. Cor. 3.7.11. ſee theſe againſt this parte of the Law, Exod. 31.13. Rom. 14.5. and Col. 2.16.17. now ſince theſe latter textes, haue no more nor better force againſt this parte of the Law, then thoſe former textes haue againſt the whole Law, what abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable partiality is here vſed, by admitting theſe textes againſt a parte of the Law, when thoſe are refuſed that be againſt the whole Law? may theſe men be ſaid to loue Gods Law, and to loue it for it ſelfe, &amp; yet to deale thus partially by it?</p>
                     <p>Yet further, where as <hi>Anabaptistes</hi> doe deny all vſe of <hi>Oathes</hi> among Chriſtians, &amp; that not onely in common talke, but alſo before A Magiſtrate, and that from theſe textes Mat. 5.34. Iam. 5.12. <hi>Sweare not at all &amp;c.:</hi> Neuertheleſſe, as generall as theſe vvords of Chriſt are againſt ſwearing, we doe diſtinguiſh of oathes, yeelding Chriſts words to be directed &amp; expounded againſt ſvvearing in our common talke vainly, but not againſt an oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore A Magiſtrate: vvhy doe not theſe textes, Mat. 5.34. Iam. 5.12. beare as ſtrongly againſt all oathes, &amp; ſo againſt an oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore A Magiſtrate; as doe theſe their textes Exod. 31.13. Rom. 14.5. Col. 2.16. againſt all Sabbaths, and ſo againſt the weekly 7th day Sabbath? can you diſtinguiſh to preſerue an oath before A Magiſtrate, &amp; can you not diſtinguiſh to preſerue Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in the Church? will you defend an oath before a Magiſtrate, as inioyned ſtill in the 3th com. which is therin but by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence, &amp; vvill you not defend Gods ancient Sabbath, as inioyned ſtill in the 4th command. which is therin expreſſed? can ſuch your partiality be excuſed?</p>
                     <p>Now to conſider of the 4th command. by it ſelfe: in this they will attempt to proue the <hi>time,</hi> to wit, the 7th day, to be a ceremony and aboliſhed; &amp; in the meane time, they will hould the dueties of <hi>Rest &amp; holineſſe,</hi> commanded with the <hi>time,</hi> to be no ceremony but morall &amp; perpetuall: now vndoubtedly, they ſhould hold all the things commanded in the 4th com. to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether morall, or together ceremoniall: either all aboliſhed, or all perpetuall: in any wiſe mans iudgment, ſuch things as God hath ioyned together, no man ſhould put aſunder, retayning
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:21140:165"/>ſomething, reiecting other ſomething; but that all muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, or all reiected: either they ſhould embrace the whole 4th commandement, or no 4th commandement: this is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The 4th com. is like vnto a <hi>Bond;</hi> in a bond there is two things where vnto men are bound; the one, is the ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the other, is the day and time of payment; now in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon, he that ſtands bound to pay the ſumme of money, that ſame man ſtands bound to the day and time alſo, that is, to <hi>pay</hi> this money at the time mentioned in the bond: ſo in the 4th com. men are bound vnto 2. things, the one, is the dueties of Reſt and holy exerciſes, the other, is vnto the day &amp; time wherein theſe dueties are to be performed, namly the 7th day. Now theſe men, that are vndertakers againſt Gods Sabbaths; &amp; enemies to the Integritie and perfection of Gods Law; they will not retaine both of theſe, nor reiect both of theſe; but a diuiſion &amp; ſeperation they muſt haue; the duties of reſt and holineſſe they will haue vs bound vnto, as being morall; but the day and time wherein they ſhould be performed, to wit, the 7th day, this they will not haue vs bound vnto, but it muſt be a ceremony: now was it euer heard before now, or euer ſeene in any caſe but this, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be bound vnto the ſumme of money, in the bond, but not vnto the day of payment? wy theſe men will moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly ſuppoſe, that vve are tyed vnto the dueties of reſt and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the com. but not vnto the duety of the time &amp; day, mentioned in the command. in vvhich the dueties are to be done: &amp; is not this abſurd to any heareing? and are not thoſe textes, vvhich they vſe for this abſurd purpoſe, vvreſted think you? as theſe Exod. 31.13. Rom. 14.5. &amp; Col. 2.17. it vvere to be vviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they vvould not halue it, &amp; peece it, on this faſhion, that is, to ſerue God by halues in his 4th com. but that they vvould obſerue the vvhole 4th commandement or no 4th command. all or none.</p>
                     <p>God hath giuen many ſeuerall commandements in the old Teſtament, as concerning the true God; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning his worſhip; concerning his Name; concerning ſondry dueties vnto our neighbour; concerning the Paſſeouer, Pentecoſt, &amp; ſondry other
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:21140:166"/>Feſtiuall dayes; new moones, &amp; Sabbaths; concerning meates &amp; drinkes; concerning Sacrifices, Tythes, Prieſts, the Temple and place of worſhip; with many more; now amongſt all theſe Lawes, can they find from the begining of the booke of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> vnto the end of the Prophecy of <hi>Malachie,</hi> ſuch a mingle mangled hotch potch as they will make of this 4th comm. that parte of thoſe lawes ſhould be morall, &amp; parte ceremoniall; one parte belonging to all Nations, the other parte onely vnto the Iewes? the like was neuer heard on, I dare ſay it, in any lawes of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> Diuine or humane: are they not aſhamed, to make ſuch A <hi>Monster</hi> of the 4th com. as the like hath not bene ſeene in the world? and are not theſe textes Rom. 14.5. Exod. 31.13. and Coloſ. 2.16.17. monſtrouſty abuſed think you, which they vſe for this monſtrouſe end?</p>
                     <p>In the 5th com. we are inioyned ij things, to honour our <hi>father;</hi> &amp; to honour our <hi>mother:</hi> &amp; in the 10th com. we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned many things, as 7 in number: &amp; in the 4th com. we are inioyned ij things, an holy reſt, &amp; the day and time wherein to kepe this holy reſt: now they that take one of theſe ij things in the 4th com. &amp; reiect the other; they are as abſurd, as if one ſhould take one of thoſe ij things inioyned in the 5th com. and reiect the other; holding it <hi>morall</hi> to honour our fathers, but <hi>ceremoniall,</hi> to honour our mothers: &amp; as abſurd they are, as if they ſhould diuide betwixt thoſe 7 things commanded in the 10th com. holding 4 of them morall, &amp; ſome ſuch 3 of them as diſconceits them moſt, for ceremonies: in a word, for any to ſay the 4th com. is partly morall, partly ceremoniall, it is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition partly religiouſe, partly prophane.</p>
                     <p>It is much like that of Papiſts, touching the 2d. com. about Images, who hold, that this 2d. com. is <hi>ceremoniall,</hi> &amp; forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth onely Iewiſh Images, not the Images of Chriſtians; and why may we not admit of Papiſts abſurdetie in the 2d. com. as well as of Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts abſurdneſſe in the 4th com. Oh, how is this abuſed Commandement, to be deplored &amp; lamented! &amp; how are the Agents herein, to be loathed and abhorred? for they attempt with that wicked man, prophecied on by <hi>Daniel, to change times &amp; lawes,</hi> Dan. 7.25. Gods 7th day, into the 8th day: and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:21140:166"/>the law of the 4th com. from off the 7th day, vnto the 8th day.</p>
                     <p>An other abſurdety is, that by alleaging Scriptures out of the new Teſtament, as Rom. 14.5. Gal. 4.10. Col. 2.16. againſt the Sabbath in the morall law, &amp; ſo fathering the abolition of that Sabbath on Chriſt and on his Paul, hereby we become a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block, ſcandale, and occation of offence vnto the Iewes; for, when they vrge vs with the 4th com. for keeping of the old Sabbath day, and we anſwer that <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> aboliſhed it, hereat they are ſcandalized, and ſay, that hereby they know Chriſt and Paul to be <hi>impoſtors</hi> &amp; <hi>deceiuers:</hi> becauſe they durſt aboliſh one of Gods ordinances in the Decalogue, which all men count morall: is not the converſion of the Iewes daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, &amp; praied for? &amp; ſhall we vnneceſſarily, hinder their coming vnto Chriſt, by fathering on Chriſt a thing both falſe, &amp; moſt odiouſe vnto the people of the Iewes? let vs beware we be not an occation any longer of the hard-hartedneſſe of the Iewes.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, other abſurdeties alſo theſe euill Age<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes runinto: he that can allow of theſe following arguments, againſt the 7th day Sabbath, he may with a ſafe conſcience turne <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> &amp; keepe no Sabbath: for the 7th day Sabbath, theſe men will throw downe, as they ſay: And for the 8th day Sabbath, thats but an idle fiction, as hath bene ſhowne; ſo then, throw downe the 7th day Sabbath, and away with all Sabbathes: for my parte, I am cleerly &amp; fully reſolued in this, that take away the 7th day Sabbath, &amp; then we are not bound to keepe any Sabbath at all, one or other: Thus theſe enemies to Gods Sabbaths, they make an high way, and open gappe vnto <hi>Anabaptiſtry,</hi> that ſo we ſhould haue no Sabbathes.</p>
                     <p>An other abſurdety is this; The time of the 7th day, it was, and alſo it may now againe (if men ſo pleaſe) be an helpe and a furtherance, vnto theſe Morall dueties, of Reſt from laboures, and the worſhip of God, commanded in the 4th Comm. for the 7th day, furthereth theſe dueties, as time and place doe further all dueties: and is it not to be wondered at, that men will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and aboliſh ſuch a thing, or things, as be helpes and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances vnto Gods worſhip, and vnto Morall dueties? Diuines
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:21140:167"/>teach, that not onely the dueties expreſſed in the Decalogue, are to be obſerued, but alſo all <hi>helpes</hi> and <hi>furtherances</hi> vnto thoſe dueties; but behold, here they reiect as Iewiſh and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall the 7th day, which was in ancient time, and may be againe, an <hi>helpe</hi> vnto Gods worſhip, and the other Sabbath due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Yea ſuch an helpe, as no other day ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſo fit: for no day but it, is a ſanctified day, Geneſ. 2.3. nor a commanded day, Exod. 20.8.10. nor that hath Gods preſident, Exod. 20.10.11.</p>
                     <p>I might here alleage the Teſtimony of many, but I will content my ſelfe with iij or iiij, who though no friends to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Sabbath, yet herein iuſtify me: <hi>Doctour Bownde</hi> in his booke of the Sabbath Pag. 40. ſaith; <hi>That the 4th. Com. can no more be partly Morall &amp; partly Ceremoniall; then the ſame liuing creature; can be partly a man, &amp; partly a beaſt: Yea, as well may one ſuppoſe the ſecond Com. alſo, to be partly Morall &amp; partly Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall.</hi> To the ſame effect, hee in pag. 36. citeth <hi>Wolph. Chron.</hi> lib. 2. ca. 1. ſaying, <hi>but the 7th day, is not to be rekoned among the figures &amp; ceremonies of the Iewes; becauſe it is commanded in the Decalogue, which conteineth in it nothing ceremoniall, nothing typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, nothing to be abrogated.</hi> M. Richard Byfield, in his <hi>Doctrine of the Sabbath vindicated,</hi> againſt <hi>M. Brerewod</hi> pag. 88. ſaith, <hi>the 4th com. is parte of the law of nature, and ſo parte of the Image of God, and is no more capable of a ceremony to be in it then God is.</hi> For concluſion, you ſhall heare doctour <hi>Ames</hi> ſpeake in the name of all beſt diuines:</p>
                     <p>In his Theologicall <hi>Theſis</hi> pag. 499. Thus he writeth: <hi>This is a moſt certaine rule, &amp; receiued by all the beſt Diuines, that the morall commandements were thus differenced in their deliuery, from the ceremoniales, that all, &amp; onely the morales, were proclaimed publikly before the people of Iſrael, from Mount Sinay, by the voyce of God himſelfe, &amp; after alſo were written, &amp; the ſecond time writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as it were by the finger of God, &amp; that in Tables of stone, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their perpetuall and immutable continuance.</hi> Now, doe you not heare how theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirme it, that the 7th day, is not to be rekoned among the <hi>figures</hi> &amp; <hi>ceremonies</hi> of the Iewes? &amp; that all <hi>best</hi> diuines hold, that <hi>all &amp; onely</hi> morales, were wrote in the Tables of ſtone? and, that the 4th com. is no more capable
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:21140:167"/>of a ceremony in it, then God is? and, that you may as <hi>abſurdly</hi> ſay, the ſame liuing creature is partly a man, &amp; partly a beaſt, as to ſay the 4th com. is partly morall, partly ceremoniall.</p>
                     <p>Before I produce their argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, I deſire to propound iiij things more, both vnto our opponentes, &amp; alſo vnto my Reader. The for moſt is this, before they begine their oppoſition &amp; wicked worke, I deſire them to caſt their eyes firſt vpon the vglineſſe of it, &amp; to viewe it well; for they fight not <hi>for</hi> God bleſſed for euer; but <hi>against</hi> God: my warfare is for God, &amp; to defend his Title touching his Sabbaths, but theirs is alltogether to defeate God of his Title and Sabbaths: my ſtrift is to defend Gods law in the Integrity and perfection, vnto a <hi>iot</hi> &amp; <hi>title</hi> of it; but their ſtrife, is with might and maine, to lame Gods law, and to clype it, as traitoures doe the Kings coyne; they will none of the law in its integrity and perfection, that ſo they may ſerue God by halues, &amp; by peece-meale.</p>
                     <p>An other thing I would propound, is this, I deſire to know of theſe, who are ſuch implacable enemies to the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, if they haue any <hi>Countermand,</hi> or contrary commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto the 4th com. and that in as plaine &amp; expreſſe termes as the 4th com: you know, that a law enacted in parliament, cannot be reuoked, but by an other law, enacted for the reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it, in the court of parliament: ſo it muſt be in this caſe; for the 7th day Sabbath, there was a law, to wit, the 4th com. enacted from heauen in the old Teſtament; &amp; they muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhew vs a law from heauen againe countermanding it in the new Teſtament, againſt the 7th day Sabbath: or, if in caſe they cannot ſhew vs A law, in expreſe words againſt the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, the which they cannot doe, then, if they be enforced in ſtead of a commandement, to flie to reaſones &amp; conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, made out of textes of Scripture, they muſt make ſuer, that their reaſones, collectiones, and conſequences, be ſo cleere and apparent, ſo ſound and ſo <hi>neceſſarily</hi> true, that they may be as <hi>vndoubtedly</hi> true, as a <hi>commandement</hi> it ſelfe: the reaſon hereof is, becauſe theſe conſequences, muſt ſtand in the roome of a commandement, for the reuoking of that Sabbath day, which was commanded in the 4th com: euery ſleity &amp; probable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:21140:168"/>therefore collected out of a text, is not enough to ouerturne an expreſſe commandement, yea a morall commandement: ſhall a ſleity collection or conſequence, fetched by mans feeble &amp; ſhallow reaſon, out of theſe &amp; the like textes Exod. 31.13. Rom. 14.5. &amp; Coloſ. 2.16.17. ouerturne a ſacred <hi>time,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly <hi>commanded</hi> in the morall law Exod. 20.8? God forbid. We muſt ſhew more loue and honour, vnto thoſe 10 comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; which God hath honoured aboue all portions of Scripture, by writing them with his owne finger, &amp; deliuering them by his owne voyce, then to ſuffer them, or any parte of them, to be ſnached &amp; wreſted out of our hands, by probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, likelihoods, &amp; feeble reaſones.</p>
                     <p>A man may well doubt of it, whither any man or <hi>Church,</hi> may aboliſh any things expreſly commanded, in the Morall Law, by any collection or conſequence of mans reaſon whatſoeuer, yea albeit it be thought of all men, to be a neceſſary conſequence: for how often doe men take that to be ſound &amp; of neceſſary trueth, which once within a fewe yeeres after, the ſame men find to be faulty: let men know therefore, that they who dare attempt ſo bould an enterpriſe, as to diminiſh any iot or title of the 10. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales by reaſones, fetched out of theſe &amp; the like textes Exod. 31.13. and Coloſ. 2.16.17. they muſt be ſuch reaſons as be as cleere as the Sunne in its brightneſſe; &amp; ſo ſatisfactory, as euery one that heareth them, cannot but applaud &amp; imbrace them, ſaying, God is in theſe reaſones and collectiones: the reaſon hereof is, becauſe theſe reaſones and conſequences, they muſt beare downe, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front an expreſſe commandement, written by the finger of God himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day, &amp;c. The 7th day is the Sabbath, in it thou ſhalt not worke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 3d thing which I would propound, ſhall be an Appeale vnto the <hi>conſciences,</hi> of all ſuch, as dare ſharpen their witts, againſt the Lords Sabbaths, which he hath placed in his Morall Law: my deſire vnto them is, that they would ranſake and ſerch their hearts, to ſee if they can find themſelues <hi>compelled,</hi> &amp; <hi>conſtrained</hi> by their conſciences, vpon the reading &amp; ſeriouſe perpending of theſe and the like textes, Exod. 31.13. Rom. 14.5. and Coloſ. 2.16.17. in the New Teſtament, to aboliſh the 7th day Sabbath or no: let

                     <p>The 4th thing to be propounded: you know it is a <hi>Maxime,</hi> &amp; a ruled caſe in diuinity, that one text of Scripture, it muſt not be ſo expounded and vrged, as it ſhould ouerthrow &amp; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict an other text: now if this rule hath place in any portion of Scripture, it muſt haue place in the 10. <hi>commandements,</hi> the <hi>Lords prayer,</hi> &amp; in the <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>faith.</hi> for theſe 3. are eſteemed to containe, the foundation, life and Soule of all religion, and that plainly; wherfore, no text of Scripture is to be vrged or expounded ſo, as it ſhould infringe, contradict or ouerturne, any portion of theſe three <hi>principles</hi> of Chriſtian religion: nay, theſe three are made as a <hi>Rule</hi> to expound other Scriptures by, &amp; therefore not to be gainſaied &amp; oppoſed by other ſcriptures: well then, the <hi>7th day Sabbath</hi> it is one of thoſe ordinances of God, eſtabliſhed of old in his Church, &amp; placed amongſt his Morall Lawes, and in the firſt Table alſo, and there expreſly commanded by one of the 10. commandements; wherefore ſince it is a parte of the 10.

                     <p>And now we come vnto their arguments, &amp; textes of Scripture, out of which they collect arguments againſt the Lords Sabbaths:
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:21140:169"/>but this note in the firſt place, that of them all, they can not ſhew vs any expreſſe <hi>commandement</hi> or prohibition, againſt the Sabbath day, to countermand it: &amp; therefore it followeth, that what they haue againſt it, the ſame is but collectiones, and conſequences, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by mans feeble reaſon: and this one thing, that they haue no expreſſe countermand, againſt the Sabbath day, doth weaken their cauſe exceedingly, &amp; it is the worſe by aboue 50. in the 100. for this wante; and ſo I proceede.</p>
                     <p>There are two thinges which they labour to make ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall and ſo aboliſhed, in the 4th com. the one is the <hi>Rest;</hi> the other is the <hi>time</hi> of the 7th day: &amp; firſt let vs ſee what they haue againſt the Reſt: they doe not ſay the Reſt from labour, is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply aboliſhed, leaſt ſo they ſhould daſhe in peeces the whole 4th com. by one word; therfore they haue refined it, and they deſire to proue the <hi>rigorouſe</hi> ſtrictneſſe of the Reſt, onely to be a ceremony: and queſtionleſſe this conceipt of the rigorouſe ſtrictneſſe of the Reſt, was therefore invented, leaſt they ſhould ſeeme onely to deny the queſtion; namly the time of the 7th day: for now thers is a little more culler put vpon the matter, when they can deny ij things as ceremonies, in the 10 comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: now to this purpoſe, euery text that may ſeeme to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of any extraordenary ſtrictneſſe, about the Iewiſh reſt (as they cale it) thoſe textes are not expounded, (as they ſay) with a graine of Salte, or any dramme of qualification, but like men that had <hi>ſworne</hi> to it, to forſake the golden meane, they are carried all wide vpon the left hand, &amp; theſe textes, are ſtretched vpon the Tainter hoocks, vnto the vtmoſt, tending to a rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſſe; &amp; he that can invent how to make this Reſt the moſt rigorouſe, he is the beſt expoſiter. And hence comes that vaine diſtinction of the Iewiſh Reſt, as if for ſooth, the 4th com. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined two kinds ef Reſt in it, A <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Reſt, &amp; A <hi>Christian</hi> Reſt; but the vanity hereof will appeare by &amp; by, when you ſhall haue ſeene the vanity of their arguments, to proue this rigorouſe &amp; Iewiſh Reſt.</p>
                     <p>Now let me ſhewe you their arguments in order; and firſt I will lay downe 3 arguments, vſed by a worthy Diuine and late writer, to proue this reſt rigorouſe, whoſe name I ſpare for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:21140:170"/>ſake: the firſt whereof is this, <hi>that the Iewe might not on the Sabbath, goe forth, or take a iourny any whither, for any buſines of his owne</hi> Exod. 16.29. this ſaith hee, <hi>was temporary, and doth not concerne theſe times of the newe Teſtament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereunto I anſwer, that this text Exod. 16.29. forbad the Iew to trauaile on the Sabbath indeede, but by the context it doth appeare, that here the Lord forbad trauailing <hi>friuolouſlie</hi> when there was no neede to trauaile: for, in as much as on the 6th day, God gaue them <hi>Manna</hi> enough for ij dayes, the 6th &amp; the 7th, &amp; ſo rained downe none on the 7th day; therefore he forbad them, to goe forth on the 7th day or Sabbath day: &amp; this was the iourney which God forbad; namly an vnneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry iourny; for why ſhould they goe abroad to ſeeke Manna, on a day, wherein there was none in the field? and why ſhould they ſeeke for it on the 7th day, when God gaue them enough on the 6th day, both for it, and for the 7th day alſo? now I pray ſhew me, where is that rigorouſe ſtrictneſſe of the Iewiſh reſt, for which end this text is brought? is that to be eſteemed a rigorouſe reſt when men are forbidden to trauaile on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, when they haue no neede at all to trauaile,? &amp; when their iourney is friuolouſe, &amp; to no purpoſe? if this be a <hi>Iewiſh</hi> ſtrictneſſe, we <hi>Christians</hi> vſe it, and vrge it at this day: for, we permit not to trauaile on the Lords day, vpon euery ſleity oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>And doe they not want matter (thinke you) againſt Gods Sabbathes, when they are forced to racke vp ſuch poore ſtuffe as this is againſt them?</p>

                     <p>Herevnto I anſwer, that this text if vnderſtod generally, it is ſet vpon the tainter hoockes, and ſtretched beyond meaſure: yee haue a text to wit, the 4th com. ſaying, <hi>in it thou ſhalt not doe any worke,</hi> this text, the ſame diuines can vnderſtand it &amp; expound it, with a due <hi>limitation,</hi> to wit, of common ordenary and ſeruile

Exod: 20.10. to kindle a fier, as Bakers doe, is a ſeruile worke; but otherwiſe it is a worke of mercy, when but to warme one, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it might haue a ſpeciall reference vnto the building of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> Exod. 35.3.4.5. whereof there was no ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary haſt, as that they ſhould kindle fiers on the Sabbath, to worke about it.</p>
                     <p>For vs to thinke, that God who allowed a <hi>beast</hi> to be led to the water on the Sabbath; and allowed the Iewes to lift a beaſt out of the ditch on the Sabbath; &amp; to plucke and rubb eares of corne on the Sabbath, wold forbid them to kindle a fier on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, to dreſſe a morſell of warme meate, for their dinner, and to warme them ſelues in cold winters weather, when they came from Church, that ſo they might be the more freſh and liuely to ſerue God againe in the afternone, thers no ſhew of reaſon in it: would God haue mercy ſhewed to a beaſt on the Sabbath, and none of a man, that is made after his Image? what likelihod is there of this?</p>
                     <p>Further our Sauiour ſaith the <hi>Sabbath was made for man</hi> Mar. 2.27. ſo to expound this text Exod. 35.3. therefore, as if a man might not, no not in a caſe of neceſſity, kindle a fier, in the time of froft and ſnow, to warme himſelfe, and the like, is to make the Sabbath not <hi>for</hi> man, but <hi>againſt</hi> man: and to make man for the Sabbath, contrary to the words of our Sauiour.</p>
                     <p>Againe our Sauiour Chriſt, was preſent at a <hi>ffeaſt,</hi> on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, Luk. 14.1.2.3.4.5.6.7. &amp;c. now at a feaſt, there is commonly a <hi>fier,</hi> to dreſſe meate for the gueſtes; &amp; there is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to be giuen by ſeruants, and the like; now Chriſt by his preſence at this feaſt, allowed of fier kindling, &amp; of others as great workes, as the kindling of a fier is: wherby it appeareth,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:21140:171"/>that this text is wreſted, when it is vnderſtod ſo <hi>rigorouſly,</hi> as if God had forbad his people to kindle a fier in any caſe: thus you ſee, that it is but a ſlaunder brought vp vpon the Iewiſh Reſt, to ſay it was rigorouſe; but ſuch ſlaunders are frequent, to loath men of Gods Sabbath.</p>

                     <p> Herevnto I anſwer. 1. for aſmuch as we find, that God hath added and expreſſed an exception to ſome Sabbaths, we may therefore thinke, that the ſame exception, is to be vnderſtod, in all Sabbaths; ſee Exod. 12.16. <hi>no worke ſhall be done; ſaue about that which euery man must eate: that only may yee doe,</hi> in which words you ſee, that albeit God forbad all manner of worke, yet he gaue an <hi>exception,</hi> allowing men to worke ſo farr forth, as may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne their preſent neceſſity, that is, to dreſſe their meate on that day, which they muſt eate on that day: I confeſſe this was a ceremoniall Sabbath, but for aſmuch as, God put no difference, betwixt the ceremoniall &amp; the Morall Sabbaths, for ſtrictneſſe of reſt (for it was death, to any man, that did any worke on either of them both, as you may ſee, Leuit. 23.30, &amp; Exod. 31.15.) therefore we may thinke, that there is the ſame reaſon of both.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſwer, that this text is not rightly vnderſtod &amp; applied: for they ſuppoſe that Moſes bad theſe Iewes bake <hi>to day,</hi> that was, on friday, all the Manna which they had gathered that day, to wit, the ij. omers, ſo as none ſhould be to bake on the next day being Sabbath day; but it is to be noted, that Moſes left it to their will, how much to bake that day, &amp; how much to leaue vnbaked; for ſaith the text, bake that which <hi>yee will bake,</hi> and ſeeth that which <hi>yee will ſeeth;</hi> he ſaid not, bake all, &amp; ſeeth all; but bake &amp; ſeeth what ye will: againe, where he ſaith that which remanieth, lay it vp vntill the morning: they vnderſtand theſe words thus, that that which remanieth <hi>baked,</hi> ſhould be laied vp; but ſo much cannot be collected out of this text; but the contrary is rather the trueth, namely, that that which remained vnbaked was laid vp vnbaked vntill the morning: &amp; this the context giueth light vnto; for on other daies if they reſerued any vntill the morning it ſtank, v. 20. but on this day, what they reſerued, it ſtank not, v. 24. now foraſmuch as Moſes recordeth it, as a wonderfull thing, that it ſtanke not, nor was full of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, by reſeruing it; it giueth vs to vnderſtand, that it was laied vp vnbaked; for what wonder had it bene, that it ſtanke not, nor had wormes in it, if it had bene baked? ſeing that baking, doth preſerue things from ſtinking, and wormes breeding: it is more
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:21140:172"/>likly therefore, that as they baked euery other day, ſo much as they did eate on that day, ſo they did on the Sabbath day: So this text proueth not, that the Iewes baked &amp; boiled all their foode, on friday.</p>
                     <p>One anſwer I heere giue vnto all their 4. texts together; if the Reſt commanded to the Iewes in the 4th com. be a rigorouſe Reſt, &amp; ſo ceremoniall, then is the whole Sabbath &amp; 4th com. vtterly aboliſhed, as rigorouſe &amp; ceremoniall alſo: for there is but one kind of Reſt in the 4th com. take away that, and take away all Reſt; &amp; if that be rigorouſe &amp; <hi>ceremoniall,</hi> take away that, and then may men follow their laboures, in their ſeuerall houſen, and in the fields.</p>
                     <p>An other anſwer I giue vnto all their 4. textes, which is this, that if it could be proued, that the Reſt which the Iewes kept, was rigorouſe, then might we more ſafely hold, that the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſneſſe of their Reſt was Iewiſh and ceremoniall, then that any thing commanded in the Morall Law, is Iewiſh and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall: for this Law of kindling a fier on the Sabbath, being not mentioned in the Morall Law, but written elſewhere, it may be queſtioned rather whither it was any branch of the 4th com. or expoſition of it; or whither it was ſome ſpeciall Law peculiar vnto the Nation of the Iewe; becauſe in thoſe hote countries, they might better want a fier then wee in coulder rigiones can, and better feed on cold meates, dreſſed the day before, then wee in theſe colder countries cane: and ſo the Morall Law ſhould be maintained ſtill in its Integrity and perfection: &amp; why may not theſe particular Lawes, not being written in the Morall Law, and Tables of ſtone, be <hi>aduentitiouſe,</hi> and onely added to the 4th com. as peculiar to the Iewes, and thoſe times &amp; Regiones, as was that Reaſon prefixed to all the 10. com. that <hi>God brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the land of Egypt,</hi> which is alſo added to the 4th com.

                     <p>Thus then you haue ſeene their textes, for the prouing of the Iewes Reſt, to be full of intollerable ſtrictneſſe &amp; rigour; but you ſe how they faile in the matter; wherefore I may ſafely conclud, that it is but a ſlaunder, raiſed vpon the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,

                     <p>Chriſt is the Lord, both of the <hi>dead</hi> &amp; of the <hi>quicke</hi> Rom. 14.9. will it follow, becauſe he is Lord of the quicke, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he will deſtroy the quicke? no, all that will follow out of this text, is no more but this, that Chriſt ſheweth vs, how we may in a caſe of neceſſity vſe ſome labour, to plucke eares of corne &amp; the like, to ſatiſfy preſent hunger: thus the Lord of
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:21140:173"/>a corne field, will in a caſe of neceſſity, permit his ſeruants, to make a <hi>pathway,</hi> thorough the mideſt of the corne; but yet wold be exceedingly wroth with them, if they ſhould trample all the field ouer, no neceſſity compelling them thereto; and ſo dealt Chriſt the Lord of the Sabbath, with his ſeruantes, he gaue them leaue to make a path thorrow it, as it were.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly it cannot be, that Chriſt did here at this time deſtroy the Sabbath day; for it was not yet time for it; for Chriſt deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; aboliſhed no ceremonies, vntill his <hi>death</hi> vpon the Croſſe Col. 2.14. if therfore the Sabbath day, had bene a ceremony, we cannot thinke that Chriſt would aboliſh it, now whilſt he liued, &amp; ſo long before his death: &amp; thus much for this text.</p>

Stinnet</hi> for one.</p>
                     <p>Herevnto I anſwer 1. by this reaſon then it ſeemeth, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prophets, nor the Church of God, that liued after the ſtanding ſtill of the Sunne in Ioſhua his time, vntill Chriſt time, did euer keepe, or were bound to keepe, the Sabbath day; or to yeeld any obedience vnto the 4th com. &amp; by this reaſon the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, neuer after the ſtanding ſtill of the Sunne, kept, or were bound to keep the <hi>paſſouer,</hi> on the 14th day of the moneth; nor their other <hi>feaſt</hi> dayes; &amp; all forſooth becauſe the ſtanding ſtill of the Sunne, had made ſuch an alteration of time, that they knew not <hi>Saturday</hi> from <hi>Sunday</hi> any longer, nor the 14th day of the moneth from the 13th or 15th dayes of the moneth: are not theſe men worthily counted enemies to Gods Sabbaths, and are they not very deſirouſe to ouerthrow them, when they ſtudy for ſuch ſimple ſtuffe as this is, againſt them? is not this to make a needleſſe, voluntary, and vnneceſſary oppoſition to Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance? for what neceſſity is here in this text; to moue a man, to oppoſe God in his Sabbathes?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I proue their grownd falſe, whereon they build; they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the 7th day cannot be knowne, becauſe of the ſtanding ſtill of the Sunne: but I proue, that long after the Sunns ſtanding ſtill, the 7th day, was knowne; for after Chriſt his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, all the iiij Euangeliſts doe cale our Sunday, the <hi>first day</hi> of the weeke: if then Sunday be the firſt day in their account, rekone onwards, &amp; Saturday after it muſt be the 7th day; ſo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſtanding ſtill of the Sunne hindreth not from the knowledge which day is the 7th, and which day is the firſt &amp;c. other anſwers I giue alſo in my former booke, but theſe are enough, &amp; too many for ſuch idle arguments.</p>
                     <p>An other argument of like nature they vſe, and this is a fit place to anſwer it, if it deſerued anſwer; it is this, if all nations be bound to keepe the 7th day Sabbath, as well as the Iew, then in ſome countries, they muſt keepe a Sabbath day, halfe a yeere together: for in ſome countrie, there is halfe a yeere light or day together.</p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:21140:174"/>
                     <p> Herevnto I anſwer 1. if this argument be good againſt the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, then is it good alſo againſt the <hi>Lords</hi> day: for how ſhall all nationes be bound to keepe the Lords day; ſeing that then in ſome countrie, they ſhall be bound to keep a Lords day, halfe a yeere long &amp;c? 2. I anſwer, by like reaſon a man may thus conclud, that the 5th com. belongeth not vnto all men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome men are not bound vnto it, as a <hi>King,</hi> whoſe father &amp; mother is dead: but what &amp; if the King who hath no ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour liuing, be not bound to the 5th com. ſhall none of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects therefore, who haue parentes and ſuperiours liuing, be bound vnto the 5th com? &amp; ſo, what if ſome one country, ſhould not be bound to the Sabbath day, becauſe of the exceeding length and diſcommodiouſneſſe of their dayes, ſhall not we &amp; other nations therefore, be bound to the Sabbath day, and 4th com. who haue dayes of convenient length, much like as the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes had in Canaan, and no ſuch incommodiouſeneſſe? In the 10th com. it is ſaid thou ſhall not couet thy <hi>neighbors aſſe:</hi> now thowſands in our country haue no Aſſes, will they therefore conclud, that ſuch men amongſt vs, whoſe neighbors haue Aſſes, are not forbidden, to Couet their neighbors Aſſe, becauſe this branch of the 10th com. doth not reach vnto euery man?</p>
                     <p>Others obiect, that we cannot keepe the Sabbath day, becauſe our Saturday begineth not iuſt at the ſome point of time, when the Iewes Sabbath day begane in <hi>Canaan;</hi> but by the like reaſon we may now ſay, that we cannot celebrate the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> neither: for, we drink not iuſt the ſelfe ſame kind of <hi>wine,</hi> which Chriſt drank at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> nor is it likly that we eate the ſelfe ſame kind of bread: for we eate whitebread, but in regard of Chriſts pouerty, it is not vnlikly that he vſed browne or corſe bread. 2. By the like, the Iewes might haue thus abſurdly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned alſo; whereas the Sabbath day was commanded on Mount Sinay, Exod. 20. yea, one moneths iourney before they came to Mount Sinay, in the wilderneſſe of Sin Exod. 16.1.23. yea, and in an other remote place, as in that parte of the world where about Paradiſe was, ſince the Sabbath was from the Creation; hence the Iewes might thus peruerſly haue argued, ſaying, wee are now in Canaan, or in Captiuity in a country that is farr
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:21140:174"/>remote from Mount Sinay, where the Sabbath was commanded, or from the wilderneſſe of Sin, or that parte of the world where Paradiſe was, and where the Patriarkes kept the Sabbath, and therfore we here cannot keepe the Sabbath: for our Sabbath in this country, begineth not at that point of time, iuſt, when the Sabbath begineth at Mount Sinay, the wilderneſſe of Sin, or about Paradiſe: loe their folly! God requireth not a people to begine his 7th day Sabbath, when other remote Nations begine theirs, but onely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when by the light of the Sunne, which rules the day, God begineth to that people his Seauenth day.</p>
                     <p>This point is further proſecuted in my former booke, but enough &amp; too much hath bene here ſaid to this idle argument: men haue ſo little reuerence of God, and of his lawes, and of his ancient ordinance the Sabbath, that they thinke any thing is good enough, how idle and ridiculouſe ſoeuer to throw againſt the ſame; euery frothie conception of an idle braine, is matter ſound enough, to buze and make a noiſe in peoples eares, againſt that <hi>ſacred time,</hi> which God himſelfe hath <hi>hallowed</hi> &amp; <hi>ſanctified;</hi> &amp; honoured amongſt his morales.</p>

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:21140:177"/>the Lords day on the 8th day for a new Sabbath; yet this doth not hinder, but that the old Sabbath, on the 7th day, may ſtand ſtill: for example, the Lord ſet vp the morall weekly Sabbath, on the 7th day, Exod. 20.8.9.10. afterwards, he ſet vp other ceremoniall yeerly Sabbaths alſo Leuit. 23.32.38.39. now the coming in of theſe other <hi>yeerly</hi> Sabbaths, did not alter change, or aboliſh the <hi>weekly</hi> Sabbath, no, here was an <hi>addition</hi> of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, no <hi>alteration</hi> of Sabbaths. Iuſt ſo it may be here, ſuppoſe that Chriſt had ſet vp a new Sabbath on the Lords day, then haue we ij. Sabbaths to keepe weekly, the old Sabbath on the 7th day, &amp; the new Sabbath on the 8th day; ſo that the ſetting vp of this Lords day Sabbath, is but an <hi>addition</hi> of a new Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath vnto the old Sabbath; like as when a man buildes a new houſe by the ſide of an old houſe, this is but an additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of houſe, to houſe; it is no alteration, or change; for the raiſeing vp of a new houſe, by the ſide of an old houſe, is not the demoliſhing &amp; throwing downe of the old houſe.</p>

Iam. 2.10.</p>
                     <p>It is to be obſerued, that of all the 10. commandements, there was the leaſt need, nay there was no neede to repeate the 4th co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. nor to vrge the obſeruation of the Sabbath day in particular: for in the daies of Chriſt, &amp; his Apoſtles, both <hi>Iewes</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentiles</hi> were very zealouſe for the obſeruation of the Sabbath day: for the <hi>Iewes,</hi> they were more ſtrict for the keeping of the Sabbath, if I may ſo ſay, then Chriſt him ſelfe was; for Chriſt would allow the plucking and rubbing eares of corne on the Sabbath day; &amp; to carry a bedd, and the like; but the Iewes could not endure it; what hote contentions did the Iewes moue againſt Chriſt, &amp; his Diſciples, for doeing ſome petty workes on the Sabbath day? yea, vpon a time, they would haue <hi>ſlaine</hi> our Sauiour, for healing of a ſicke man, vpon the Sabbath day, Ioh. 5.16. what neede then was there, that <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles,</hi> ſhould repeate the 4th com. to the <hi>Iewes?</hi> or vrge them to keepe the Sabbath day? ſince they were ſo hote for it alredy: it was enough that the

And for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> there was no need to preſſe them neither; for, they coming into the Inheritance of the Iewes, &amp; ioyning in communion with the beleeuing Iewes, did redely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the very ceremonies of the Iewes, as <hi>circumciſion</hi> &amp; the like; how much more then did they imbrace the <hi>Morals</hi> with the Iewes, as the <hi>Sabbath day?</hi> as you may ſee, Act. 13.42.44.

They fetch an argument from Deut. 5.15. where the 4th com. is repeated, and at the end of it there is added, as a reaſon, theſe words; <hi>For, remember that thou waſt a ſeruant in the Land of Egypt, &amp; that the Lord thy God brought the out thence by a mightie hand: Therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to obſerue the Sabbath day.</hi> Hence they argue to this effect, that becauſe the Sabbath, doth depend vpon the deliuerance out of Egypt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince the deliuerance out of Egypt belongeth not vnto vs, no more doth the Sabbath day: this text <hi>M.

                     <p n="12">12. They argue from Mat. 12. where Chriſt defending his Diſciples, for plucking the eares of corne on the Sabbath day, doth rekone vp, compare, and ioyne the Sabbath day, with ceremonies, as with the <hi>Showbreade,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and the like; which compariſons and arguments (ſaith <hi>Walaeus</hi> on the 4th com. p. 21.) were of no force, if the Sabbath day, were not to be rekoned of as a ceremony in ſome ſorte.</p>
                     <p>Herevnto I anſwer. 1. why ſhould not Chriſts argument haue force, albeit the Sabbath day were rekoned of as a morall? for at that time when Chriſt made that argument, the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were all in force, as well as morales; and all bound men to obedience, as well as morales; and the breach of a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall was a ſinne, as well as the breach of a morall: wherfore Chriſt might very well fetch an argument from a ceremoniall vnto a morall; ſhewing that if it were no ſinne to violate a ceremoniall law, in a cale of neceſſity, no more was it a ſinne to breake the morall Sabbath, by rubbing eares of corne on the Sabbath day, in a caſe of neceſſity: the argument could not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer but be good vnto the Iewes, for they put no difference betwixt morals &amp; ceremoniales, as we doe; they tyethed <hi>minte,</hi> &amp; <hi>annyſe,</hi> &amp; left the weightie matters of the law: and therefore Chriſt his argument might haue, and had force enough.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſwer, Chriſt doth not onely rekone the Sabbath with
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:21140:180"/>ceremonies, and fetch arguments vnto it from ceremonies, but alſo from morales: for example ſee Mat. 12.6. <hi>I will haue mercy and not Sacrifice:</hi> where you ſee our Sauiour, fetching an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Sabbath day, from the worke of <hi>mercy,</hi> ſhewing that ſome worke may be done on the Sabbath day, in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, becauſe God will haue mercy exerciſed towards men; now mercy is no ceremony, but a morall: the like you haue Mat. 12.11, 12. where Chriſt fetcheth an argument to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, from the helpeing of a beaſt out of a pit: now to ſaue the life of a beaſt is no ceremony, but morall. Thus it appeareth, that Chriſt fetched arguments to the Sabbath, from ceremonials and morals both, making no difference in this reſpect; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be concluded, that the Sabbath is either morall, or ceremoniall from this argument</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whereas hee ſaith the Sabbath is to be rekoned among the ceremonies (in ſome ſorte) all this may be, and yet the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity of the Sabbath nothing infringed: for in this <hi>ſorte</hi> it may be like them, that as <hi>Sacrifice</hi> &amp; ceremonies were to giue place, in a caſe of neceſſity, ſo muſt the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day doe: thus then the Sabbath may be like vnto ceremonies, &amp; yet farre <hi>vnlike</hi> to them in <hi>duration,</hi> &amp; ceremoniall typicalneſſe; ſee ſtill, how witty and willing men are, to invent ſomthing againſt Gods ordinances ſure I am, men ſhold imploy their Talents, rather to defend Gods Title, then to defeate him of it.</p>

Iam. 5.12. beare as ſtrongly againſt an oath before a Magiſtrate, as doth this text Rom. 14.5. againſt the 7th day Sabbath, and yet you can find wayes to preſerue an oath ſtill in the Common wealth, and can you not finde a way to preſerue the Sabbath day ſtill in the Church? ſee your partiallity, and be aſhamed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:21140:181"/>ſacrificed vnto Idoles, and others refuſed &amp; would not eate; ſo ſome might keepe thoſe dayes, thinking it fit to ſerue God on thoſe dedicated dayes, wherein they were wont to ſerue their Idoles; but others thought it vnfit &amp;c: This the context giueth ſome light vnto, ſee Gal. 4.8.9.10. where the Apoſtle putteth the Galatians in minde of the time when <hi>they knew not God, and did ſeruice vnto them which are not Gods,</hi> and then he telleth them, that now they <hi>knew God</hi> v. 9. and then he addeth his reproofe ſaying, <hi>how turne yee againe vnto beggerly rudiments &amp;c. ye obſerue daies &amp;c:</hi> by which orderly placing of theſe things, and by his minding them of the time wherein they were Idolaters, and herevpon ſpeaketh of their <hi>turning againe,</hi> this giueth vs to vnderſtand, that he ſpeaketh of their turning againe vnto ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they vſed in the time of their Idolatry, when they knew not God: and ſo the dayes and times which he reproued them for obſeruing, might be the dayes dedicated vnto Idoles: this ſenſe <hi>M. Perkines</hi> fauoureth, in his Caſes of conſcience, Chapt. 16. Sect. 3. pag. 108. and thus <hi>Walaeus</hi> on the 4th com. pag. 93. anſwereth to theſe textes, as ſpoken of the Gentiles <hi>white</hi> and <hi>blacke,</hi> dayes <hi>cleane</hi> and vncleane meates. The like may be ſaid of the dayes ſpoken of in Rom. 14.5. for, it is like that the dayes here mentioned, were of the ſame kind, with the meates, ſpoken of in the ſame chapter v. 2.3.14. now it is like that theſe meates here ſpoken of were meates ſacrificed vnto Idoles, as 1. Cor. 10.27. of which, ſome beleeuers would eate, others being weake would not eate: &amp; I doe the rather thinke theſe might be meates ſacrificed vnto Idoles, then meates vncleane by the Leuiticall law, becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>eating of herbes</hi> Rom. 14.2. Now I remember no law, about eating or not eating of herbes: it is therfore more probable, that this eating of herbes by the weake, was an heatheniſh ſuperſtition, and of an indifferent nature, as they vſed it: and ſo, as the meates were meates ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to Idoles, ſo theſe dayes were dayes dedicated to Idoles.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if this ſenſe pleaſeth not, but it will be rather, judged that theſe meates &amp; daies, were ſuch as were inioyned by the Law to Gods people the Iewes; why then, I diſtinguiſh of daies: there were <hi>daies Morall,</hi> &amp; <hi>daies ceremoniall:</hi> or daies which
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:21140:181"/>God ranked among his Morales, or daies that were excluded the hedge &amp; pale of the Morals, &amp; neuer came into the Tables of ſtone: the Morall daies, were the weekly Sabbaths on the 7th day; the ceremoniall daies, were the yeerly Sabbaths, their new Moones, &amp; other feſtiuall daies: now the Apoſtle in both theſe textes, may be vnderſtod to ſpeake againſt theſe ceremoniall yeerly Sabbath daies, new moones, and feſtiuall daies: thus the Apoſtle may be vnderſtod, &amp; yet no wrong or viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at all offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto theſe textes; &amp; by this meanes theſe texts are ſo expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as they doe not contradict nor ouerthrow any other text of Scripture, or portion of the 10. commandements, nor doe we rune into thoſe abſurdeties, which they of the contrary opinion doe ruſh vpon.</p>
                     <p>Behold how eaſy a matter it is, to <hi>reconſile</hi> ſcripture with ſcripture, the 4th com. with other textes ſeeming to contradict it, to ſuch as haue eyes in their heads, and affectiones in their hartes to doe it: but when they, theſe aduerſaries to Gods trueth, come to touch theſe &amp; the like textes, with their polluted ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, &amp; impure minds, by way of expoſition &amp; argumentation, they are ſo farre off from <hi>reconciling</hi> of the holy ſcriptures, as they will make no worke of it, but to ſet Scripture by the eares, as they ſay; text againſt text, making one text as fier, the other as water; the one iuſleing &amp; ſhouldering out of place the other; the one text commandeth the 7th day, the other they make to forbidde the 7th day: &amp; yet all this hurly burley, &amp; oppoſition of text againſt text, is made needleſly, &amp; cauſeleſly; no thing mouing therevnto, but the corrupt minds of ſuch as are enemies to this ancient ordinance of Gods Sabbath: for ſuer I am, thers nothing in the textes themſelues, to moue them &amp; compell them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: it ſeemeth therefore, that theſe men had rather be againſt God, then for God; &amp; rather throw downe his ordinance, then vphold and maintaine it, thus you ſee, none of theſe textes hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto alleaged, will proue, that the time, &amp; 7th day comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the 4th com. is aboliſhed.</p>

                     <p> For matter of abſurdety. 1. it appeareth in this, that by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this text Exod. 31. againſt the morall and weekly Sabbath, commanded in the morall Law, hereby they <hi>picke quarrels</hi> with God, &amp; his ordinances: for, this text doth not <hi>ſay,</hi> that becauſe the Sabbath is a ſigne, therby you ſhall know it for certaine, that it ſhall be aboliſhed: no, but becauſe the Sabbath is here caled a ſigne, therefore hence they will needs <hi>collect,</hi> that it muſt be aboliſhed: &amp; for furtherance of this wicked collection, all their wites &amp; invention are ſet on worke, partly ſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this text, as it may not be vnderſtod of the yeerly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths by no meanes, leaſt ſo the morall &amp; weekly Sabbath ſhould be preſerued from ruine and deſtruction; &amp; therfore they will expound it of this morall and weekly Sabbath, that ſo it may be aboliſhed, &amp; its light extinguiſhed: partly how to proue all ſignes to be aboliſhed, &amp; the like: and this is done to this euill end alſo, that ſo they may bring the Sabbath of the Lord, within the compaſſe of an aboliſhed ſigne, and ſo quite raſe it out of the morall Law, and roote it out of the Church: thus you ſee, how they ſeeke out for, and ſtudy to find matter againſt Gods ordinance; and all this needleſly and cauſleſly, ſaue that they beare a grudge againſt the Lords Sabbaths, and would haue them prophaned: for what other reaſon can they render of this their fact? ſuer I am, this text Exod. 31. doth not compell them to ſay any thing againſt the 7th day Sabbaths: for they are faint to vſe their beſt witts, to inuent ſomething in it, that may make againſt Gods Sabbath, and is not this then to picke a quarrell with Gods ordinance?</p>
                     <p>S. Paul ſaith, <hi>Loue thinketh no euill</hi> 1. Cor. 13.5. &amp; ſuer I am, theſe men thinke no good: for did they loue Gods Sabbaths, and Gods commandements for themſelues, vnleſſe, ſome ſpirit of ſlumber for the preſent hath poſſeſſed them, they could not but ſhew their loue to Gods 4th com. as well as to the reſt of the commandements, &amp; manifeſt their loue alſo in time of <hi>triall,</hi> by thinking good, and that which might make for the preſeruation of Gods Sabbaths, &amp; 4th com. intirly, rather then by thinking euill of them, to doe ſome act againſt them: how can men think worſe of any thing, then to labour its abolition, ruine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? yea, &amp; that too, when they need not ſo doe, hauing
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:21140:183"/>no cauſe mouing them therevnto, ſaue a corrupted mind: this is a malitiouſe &amp; wicked ſpirit, that will ſtudy the ouerthrow of an ancient ordinance of God, yea an ordinance as ancient as any in the Church of God what ſoeuer, and labour to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it cauſleſly: I wiſh M. Chappel, &amp; his other 9. confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Miniſters would thinke of this point: at the latter end, after I had handled the 4th com. I gaue ſondry effectuall reaſones to moue vs to the loue of Gods Law; &amp; is this the loue that men beare to it, to <hi>ſeeke</hi> out how &amp; which way they may ouerthrow for euer ſome parte of it?</p>
                     <p>And what will be the iſſue of all this? why euen this: hereby Gods <hi>Morall</hi> Law, ſhall become a <hi>morall-ceremoniall</hi> Law: Gods <hi>Law</hi> ſhall be <hi>maimed,</hi> &amp; denied its integrity &amp; perfection: yea a godly <hi>prayer</hi> of our Church, ſhall become a <hi>babling</hi> before God: &amp; thoſe moſt ancient <hi>Churches,</hi> which liued next the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, &amp; are therfore accounted the moſt pure Churches, ſhall be <hi>condemned,</hi> in that they religiouſly obſerued this Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond abſurdety, that theſe men who are partiall in Gods Law, doe fale into, by ſharpening their wites, to fetch an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of this text, Exod. 31.13. againſt the 7th day Sabbath, is this; that hereby they doe <hi>contradict</hi> them ſelues moſt foulely; for, they teach &amp; maintaine, that the <hi>Reſt</hi> in the 4th com. is morall &amp; perpetuall: &amp; yet for all that, they will bring an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out of this text, which doth plainly ouethrow this <hi>Reſt,</hi> as well as any thing elſe: for, the Hebrew word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Reſt:</hi> now then, if the <hi>Sabbath</hi> here mentioned, Exod. 31.13. be a ſigne, and ſo aboliſhed, ſo muſt alſo the <hi>Rest</hi> ſignified by the word Sabbath, be a ſigne alſo, &amp; aboliſhed too: and yet for all this, will they haue this Reſt morall &amp; perpetuall? will they haue this Sabbath or Reſt, both morall and ceremoniall? what a groſſe contradiction is this?</p>
                     <p>Yet further, it is to be noted, that whereas the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs, is about the time &amp; day onely; for they would aboliſh the 7th day, this text which they bring doth not ſo much as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the word <hi>day</hi> in Exod. 31.13.14. for it mentioneth onely the word <hi>Sabbaths:</hi> whenc I gather, that though the word day be implied, yet becauſe it is not mentioned, therefore if any
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:21140:183"/>thing be made a ſigne of Chriſt, it is rather the Sabbaths, then the day: wherefore, if the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> be a ſigne of Chriſt, which ſignify <hi>Reſtes,</hi> then are the Reſtes, ceremonies, and aboliſhed ſignes of Chriſt: &amp; ſo the <hi>Reſt</hi> in the 4th com. which they hold to be morall, by this text they make to be ceremoniall: ſo we haue a morall ceremoniall Reſt, a contraicted Reſt.</p>
                     <p>A third abſurdety that theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fale into, who will haue God ſerued by halues and by peecemeale, is this; that whilſt they make a gloriouſe ſhew to the people, that they ſtand for the 4th com. as well as for the reſt of the commandements, they doe notwithſtanding ſo gelde it, &amp; picke out the life &amp; ſoule of it, as they leaue it but like a <hi>deade corpſe;</hi> for, by their conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (ſuch as they are) they would out of this text, Exod. 31.13. make the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> a ſigne, &amp; ſo a ceremony, and ſo then abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed: well then, be it ſo; hence then I argue, <hi>If that Sabbath day, commanded in the 4th com. be an aboliſhed ſigne &amp; ceremony, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the 4th com. nullified, &amp; like a dead corpſe;</hi> for, it ſtandeth for a cipher, and commandeth iuſt nothing: for the cleering of this point, let vs ſee the 4th com. thus it is written, <hi>Remember the (Sabbath day) to ſanctifi it,</hi> Exod. 20.8. let any man now take out of theſe words, in this commandement, theſe ij. words (Sabbath day) &amp; then let him tell me, what it is which the 4th com. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth: you may as well take away theſe ij. words (Sabbath day) which they ſay are a <hi>ſigne,</hi> and ceremony, and aboliſhed; &amp; in ſtead of them, put ſo many ciphers in the commandement, as there be letters in theſe ij. words, that is tenn, &amp; then we may write this commande. thus, <hi>Remember the (0000000000) to ſanctifie it,</hi> Exod. 20.8.</p>
                     <p>I remember our Sauiour Chriſt hath a ſimilitude, wherin he likeneth ſuch hearers as heare, but doe not, vnto a fooliſh man, who builded his howſe vpon the ſande, Mat. 7.26. but I now tell you of builders, &amp; builders in Gods houſe too, who are more fooliſh then this fooliſh man, for he built, though not vpon a rocke, yet he built vpon the <hi>Sande,</hi> ſo as his houſe might ſtand vntill the floodes came &amp; the winds blewe; but theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, would build Gods 4th com. vpon worſe then ſand, for they build it vpon nothing (0000000000) and make it to command
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:21140:184"/>nothing 0000000000. all this muſt needs be true againſt them vnleſſe they can ſhew vs, that there were two Sabbath daies ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the 4th com. one vpon the 7th day, &amp; an other vpon the 8th day; and this they cannot doe, ſeing the Lord ſpake in the <hi>ſingular</hi> number, in his 4th com. ſaying, Remember the Sabbath <hi>day,</hi> and not in the <hi>plurall</hi> number, Remember the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, or Remember the Sabbath <hi>daies:</hi> now foraſmuch as they haue robbed the 4th com. of one Sabbath day, there muſt now be no Sabbath day in the 4th com. vnleſſe they cane by helpe of their magnified reaſon &amp; conſequences proue vnto vs, that God commanded ij: Sabbaths in his 4th com.</p>
                     <p>A fourth abſurdety that theſe men fale into (who are aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the Integrity &amp; perfection of Gods Law, by reiecting his Sabbaths) is this; that they ſet Scriptures togeather by the eares, text againſt text, and God againſt himſelfe: for whereas it is a <hi>rule,</hi> that no expoſition, &amp; by like reaſon, no conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is to be giuen of and from any text, which is contrary vnto other plaine texts of Scripture, as for example, the 10. <hi>commandements,</hi> &amp; the <hi>analogie of faith,</hi> &amp;c. yet theſe aduerſaries of Gods trueth, haue giuen ſuch expoſitiones of, &amp; conſequences from this one text, Exod. 31.13. as whereby they doe vtterly nullify ſomething, plainly &amp; expreſly commanded in the 10 commandements, as for example the 7th day Sabbaths.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then their abſurdety appeareth, in ſweruing from the common receiued &amp; approued <hi>rule:</hi> &amp; ſecondly in making one portion of holy write, to contradict an other; yea to contradict an <hi>ordinance,</hi> commanded in the <hi>Morall Law:</hi> &amp;, which is yet worſt of all, they make their owne idle brained conſequences, fetched out of this text, which neuer were in it, to contradict an expreſſe commandement of the <hi>greate</hi> Gods: ſo that now, mans ſawcy reaſon, &amp; friuolouſe collections ſhall confront a plaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of his Gods: yea, it ſhall ſit in equall throne with God: I, &amp; which is worſe, it ſhall take the right hand of God alſo: for their conſequences doe more auaile with men, then Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commandement; &amp; their <hi>collections,</hi> ſhall be a <hi>Counter mand,</hi> to Gods <hi>commandement:</hi> yea, they ſhall take the vpper hand of it, &amp; ſhoulder it qui e out of place, as we ſee to our hearts aſtoniſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ment it doth, when we looke vpon the ruined 7th
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:21140:184"/>day Sabbath: on times! oh manners! oh wicked manners of theſe ſinefull times! ſome men doe ſo pride themſelues in their wit, &amp; beare themſelues ſo ſtrongly vpon their lerning, as by theſe they dare make an aſſault vpon <hi>God,</hi> and Syllogiſtically cruſh to nothing, what God once eſtabliſht in his Church, with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thunder and lightening: were this done by ſome profane perſon, it were not ſo much to be thought on; but the Authores &amp; ſtife Agents in this moſt horrible fact, are ſuch as drawe nere vnto God, and called puritane Miniſters: oh that they ſhewed more <hi>purity</hi> then this comes to: it grieueth me, thus to blow vp the Skirtes of my bethren, but I haue none other way left vnto me now but onely this one, to diſcouer them vnto the world, that they may be aſhamed of their folly; &amp; to preuent men in following them; elſe they will leade the world after them, ſo mad they are in their dotages, &amp; ſo vnmouable: the Prophet Dauid hath a paſſage which will beare me out in this, <hi>fill their faces with ſhame, that they may ſeeke thy name, o Lord.</hi> Pſal. 83.16.</p>
                     <p>I might for theſe reaſons &amp; abſurdeties of theirs, reiect their arguments, as vnworthy any anſwer at all; for they deſerue none: yet as Salomon ſaith, <hi>Leaſt they be wiſe in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi> Pro. 26.5 and thinke there is worth and excellency in their arguments, I will miſeſpend ſome time, and waſte ſome paper and inke, to ſhew them their vanity: &amp; ſo I come to their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. I conceiue they may argue out of this text Exod. 31.13. theſe wayes; the firſt whereof is this, <hi>All Signes are aboliſhed: But the 7th day Sabbath, is a Signe,</hi> Exod. 31.13. <hi>Therefore the 7th day Sabbath is aboliſhed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this argument I anſwer, as for the minor, it ſhall be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in the after paſſages: but as for their Major, I deny it: for, they can not proue it: &amp; I giue inſtances to the contrary, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all Signes are not aboliſhed: for example, the Raine bow, God made it a Signe that he would neuer more deſtroy the world by a floode of waters Geneſ. 9.12.13. neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Raine bow is not aboliſhed; for wee ſee it ſtill in the cloudes, in rainey weather. For other ſignes ſtill remayning ſee the proofe of the next Major, &amp; ſee theſe Scriptures Ro. 3.25.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:21140:185"/>Phil. 1.28. 2. Theſ. 1.5. and thus much for anſwer to this argument.</p>
                     <p>An other way whereby they may argue out of this textis this, <hi>All Signes of Chriſt are aboliſhed. But the 7th day Sabbath, is a Signe of Chriſt: Therefore the 7th day Sabbath is aboliſhed.</hi> But I deny this wholl argument, both Major and Minor.</p>
                     <p>For the Major, I deny that all ſignes of Chriſt are aboliſhed: For, they can not proue it: and becauſe there are ſondry ſignes of Chriſt remayning ſtill: for example, the Bridgroome, was made a type or ſigne of Chriſt Ioh. 3.29. Reuel. 29.9. and as we reade euery where in the booke of the <hi>Canticles:</hi> ſo the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard Ioh. 10.11. was made a ſigne of Chriſt; and yet theſe relationes remaine ſtill: we haue <hi>Bridgroomes</hi> ſtill, and <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards</hi> ſtill. 2. certaine meates legally vncleane, as the <hi>Hare,</hi> the <hi>Conie,</hi> and the <hi>Swine</hi> Leuit. 11.5.6.7. they were made a ſigne of Chriſt Act. 10.14.15. Col. 2.16. and, yet for all that, all Hares, Conies, and Swine, are not aboliſhed, no nor as touching abſtenence from them, as in a faſt. 3. The <hi>Rocke</hi> in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, was made a ſigne of Chriſt, 1 Cor. 10.4. and yet the Rocke is not vaniſhed out of its place, becauſe it was once a ſigne of Chriſt, nor is it become vſeleſſe, but that men may waſh and cattell drink at it to this day. 4. I might add, that <hi>circumciſion,</hi> being a Sacrament, it was a ſigne of Chriſt Rom. 4.11. &amp; yet thoſe infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, circumciſed a little before Chriſt his death, their circumciſion was not <hi>gathered</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or nullified and aboliſhed, immediatly after Chriſts death, nor in all the time of their liues after, ſee 1. Cor. 7.18. by all which inſtances, it is manifeſt that all ſignes of Chriſt, are not aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the Minor; and here I deny, that the 7th day Sabbath, was at any time a Signe of Chriſt conſidered as <hi>incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:</hi> their text Exod. 31.13. ſaith indeed; that the Sabbath was a ſigne; but it doth not ſay, that the Sabbath was a Signe of Chriſt: indeed the text ſpeaketh of Iehouah, God the father vnder this word <hi>Lord,</hi> but it is altogether ſilent of God the Sonne, Chriſt Ieſus, conſidered as mediator &amp; incarnate: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:21140:185"/>this text maketh nothing for their purpoſe; and thus is this ſecond argument anſwered.</p>
                     <p>Neuertheleſſe, ſome reply and vrge this text further for the prouing of this Minor, ſaying, that God ſanctifyeth vs, by Chriſt conſidered as incarnate, as is plaine Eph. 1.3. Herevnto I anſwer behold! what ſhufling is heere, is this the way to proue by neceſſary conſequence, when they are forced from one text, to flie vnto an other text? were there that neceſſary conſequence (where of they talke) in their argument out of this text, they ſhould not neede to flie vnto an other; is not this to picke aquar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell againſt Gods ordinance; &amp; voluntarily without any neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to <hi>ſeeke</hi> out for matter againſt God? but all this will nothing auaile them: For, 1. I haue ſome exceptiones againſt the text in my former booke p. 138. 2dly, admit that God doth ſanctify by Chriſt, yet it followeth not; that what ſouer is made a ſigne of God the Father, and of God the Sonne conſidered as God, it muſt alſo be a ſigne, of God the Sonne conſidered as redeemer and incarnate: ſo greate is the difference betwixt Chriſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as God coequall with the father, and conſidered as God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man incarnate, as that which being a ſigne of God the father, though it muſt alſo be a ſigne of God the Sonne conſidered as God coequall to the father, yet it is not neceſſary that it ſhould be a ſigne alſo of God the Sonne conſidered as God-man and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate.</p>
                     <p>Further more, I will giue three anſwers more vnto this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the firſt is by diſtinguiſhing of <hi>Signes;</hi> if the Sabbath here be a ſigne of Chriſt, then there are ſome ſignes of Chriſt, which are euer <hi>preſent</hi> with the thing <hi>ſignified,</hi> as in this text Exod. 31.13. where the text ſpeaketh in the preſent tenſe, <hi>doe,</hi> it is a Signe, that I the Lord <hi>doe</hi> ſanctify you: where you ſee, this is a <hi>Signe</hi> of ſomthing as <hi>preſent:</hi> &amp; there be ſome Signes of Chriſt, which are farre diſtant from the thing ſignified, where the ſigne was <hi>preſent,</hi> but the thing ſignified was <hi>future;</hi> of this kind was <hi>circumciſion, ſacrifices, meates and drinkes, new Moones, and yeerly Sabbathes:</hi> now the former ſenſe is it which they muſt imbrace, by this text Exod. 31.13. and in this ſenſe, I deny, that ſuch ſignes of Chriſt are aboliſhed: for albeit it were ſo, that of the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:21140:186"/>latter kind of ſignes, where the ſigne and the thing ſignified were farre aſſunder in time, that at the preſence of the thing ſignified the ſigne vaniſhed; yet is there not like reaſon in the former kind of ſignes; for then the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> which was made a ſigne of Chriſt (as they ſay) <hi>then preſently ſanctifying the Iſralites,</hi> ſhould haue vaniſhed and haue bene aboliſhed, euen in thoſe dayes wherein Moſes wrote this text Exod. 31.13. for then at that time, was the <hi>Signe</hi> and the thing <hi>Signified</hi> preſent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is a ſigne that I the Lord <hi>doe</hi> ſanctify you, ſaith the text.</p>
                     <p>My ſecond anſwer is this, whereas they build ſo ſtrongly vpon it, that the Sabbath day, was here made a ſigne of Gods, and ſo alſo of Chriſts ſanctification, as if <hi>ſanctification</hi> were a maine thing ſignified, and typed out, by the Sabbath, this I deny: the Sabbath was not made a ſigne of Sanctification: but onely a ſigne of <hi>God the Lord.</hi> For the word Sanctifie in this text, is vſed as a <hi>deſcription</hi> of God, not as the <hi>antitype</hi> or thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: the antitype or thing ſignified is onely the <hi>Lord:</hi> as if the text were thus read, <hi>My Sabbath is a ſigne, that yee may know, that I am the Lord:</hi> or, <hi>that I am the Lord, who doe ſanctifie you:</hi> For confirmation of this ſee Ezek. 20.20.12. where the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is repeated thus, <hi>Sanctify my Sabbathes, &amp; they ſhall be a ſigne betwene me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereby you may ſee, that the thing ſignified by the Sabbath, was the <hi>Lord our God;</hi> for God would giue his people a ſigne, whereby they might know <hi>him,</hi> that ſanctifieth them, from all falſe Gods: now if the word <hi>ſanctify</hi> had bene the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and typed, then that word would not haue bene omitted here, as being the chiefe thing intended: Thus you ſee, the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was no ſigne of <hi>Sanctification;</hi> and yet vpon this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they build all this their argument.</p>
                     <p>My third anſwer, is by diſtinguiſhing of the word <hi>ſanctify:</hi> it may be taken 1. For that inherent grace of <hi>holineſſe</hi> which is wrought in the hearts of the Elect, by the holy Ghoſt; or 2. For an <hi>externall priuilege,</hi> whereby a Nation or people are ſeuered from other Nations and people, to participate of the outward ordinances of God, as the word and Sacraments &amp;c. Rom. 3.1.2.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:21140:186"/>Rom. 9.4. Deut. 4.8.34. Exod. 19.10. now admit the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was made a ſigne of Sanctification, then may the word Sanctifie in the text, be vnderſtode of this latter kind of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication onely: now this Sanctification cannot haue reference vnto Chriſt, conſidered as incarnate; for if it hath, then the text muſt rune thus: <hi>keepe yee my Sabbaths; for they are a Signe, that I the Lord (Chriſt) doe ſanctifie you:</hi> Now the Lord Chriſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as incarnate, could not be ſayed to ſanctifie thoſe Iſralites in Moſes his time: that is, to take the people of the Iewes then from other Nationes, and beſtow vpon them thoſe holy Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of his <hi>Oracles, circumciſion,</hi> and the reſt: for, hee was not incarnate of 2000 yeeres after that.</p>
                     <p>A third way whereby I ſuppoſe they may argue out of this text Exod. 31.13. is this: <hi>All ſignes, whoſe things ſignified or anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>types be come weare forthwith aboliſhed: But the 7th day Sabbath, was a ſigne, whoſe antitype is long ſince come: Therefore, the 7th day Sabbath, was forthwith (at the death of Chriſt) aboliſhed.</hi> For the trueth of the Major, this they thinke to proue, partly by that text Col. 2.16.17. and partly from that common receiued <hi>axiome,</hi> that <hi>when the body is come, the ſhaddow or ſigne vaniſheth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Herevnto I anſwer, 1. for the text Col. 2.16.17. that this text will not helpe them; for our queſtion now is aboute <hi>ſignes:</hi> But this text ſaith nothing of Signes, for it ſpeaketh onely of <hi>Shaddowes:</hi> now there may be greate difference made betwixt a ſigne and a Shaddow; For, euery Shaddow may be a ſigne, but euery Signe is not a Shaddow: we haue the word Shaddow vſed but thrice in the new Teſtament, as in Col. 2.17. and in Heb. 8.5. and in Heb. 10.1. and it is euer vſed to ſignifie a thing to come <hi>futurlie,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh plainly, <hi>Which are a ſhaddow, of things, to come</hi> Col. 2.17. And againe, <hi>The law hauing a ſhaddow of good things to come.</hi> Heb. 10.1. But now, Signes are vſed to ſignify things <hi>paſt</hi> Exod. 31.17. Rom. 4.11. and ſomtimes things to <hi>come,</hi> Geneſ. 17.8.11. and ſomtime to ſignify a thing <hi>preſent</hi> as Exod. 31.13. wherefore ſeeing there is ſo greate a difference, betwixt a ſigne and a Shaddow, we muſt not confound them; the Apoſtle would aboliſh no more but ſuch <hi>ſignes</hi> onely, as did ſignify things to <hi>come:</hi> and the Sabbath
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:21140:187"/>in Exod. 31.13. is made onely a ſigne of a thing <hi>preſent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Haue theſe men an indifferent reſpect with <hi>Dauid</hi> vnto <hi>all</hi> Gods commandements Pſal. 119.6. (think you) when they bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour it ſo ſtudiouſly, to ouerthrow a parte of them? and may not theſe men be ſaid to <hi>loue</hi> Gods law from the <hi>heart,</hi> and to be true friends vnto it, when they vſe all their wit and lerning, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw an ordinance of Gods, commanded expreſly in that law? and what will be the iſſue of this their thankleſſe worke? why this, the <hi>bright</hi> ſhining <hi>law</hi> of God, which is a light vnto our feete Pſal. 119.105. it ſhall by this their greate ſtudy haue a <hi>darke</hi> ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or ceremony, placed in the very <hi>heart</hi> of it: yea, it ſhall be made a very <hi>monstre</hi> among Gods lawes: For of all Gods lawes from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to <hi>Malachie</hi> there is not one like it: ſuch a hotch potch they haue made it: it ſhall be partly fiſh parly fleſh, partly white partly blake, partly morall partly ceremoniall, partly <hi>aboliſhed</hi> partly <hi>entaining:</hi> may they not be in loue with this their worke, to behold the vglineſſe of it?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſwer to their <hi>axiome,</hi> and ſo alſo to their Major, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall that all ſignes muſt forthwith vaniſh, when the antitype and thing ſignified is come; and I giue theſe inſtances to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. 1. The <hi>Paſſeouer Lamb,</hi> it was a Signe that God would ſpare the Iſraelites at midnight, when he came to deſtroy the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne of the Egyptians; now this Paſſeouer, it was eaten in the <hi>Euening</hi> before this <hi>midnight,</hi> ſo that it was a ſigne of a deliuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to <hi>come,</hi> as namly in the night after: now midnight being come, and the Angel bauing Paſſed-ouer, &amp; ſpared the firſtborne of the Iſraelites, here then the antitype or thing ſignified by the Paſſeouer, was come: and yet for all that, this Signe of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, it was not forthwith aboliſhed; for it laſted many hundreth of yeeres after, euen till the laſt Supper of Chriſt: ſee Exod. 12.6.13.29.25. Luk. 22.15. yea, it remained ſtill as a ſigne of thier deliuerance which was paſt, come and gone long before, as you may ſee Exod. 12.26.27. loe here, the ſigne remained, long after the thing ſignified was come and gone: for, the fathers were to inſtruct their Children, when they were in <hi>Canaan,</hi> that this Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer was kept in remembrance of Gods deliuerance from the deſtroying Angell, whilſt they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which <hi>deliuerance</hi>
                        <pb n="339" facs="tcp:21140:187"/>was long before this <hi>Paſſeouer,</hi> and this Paſſeouer long after the deliuerance ſignified by it: And vvhy may not the <hi>Sabbath</hi> laſt alſo in the Church (if it were a <hi>ſigne)</hi> long after Chriſts coming in the fleſh, euen till his laſt coming vnto iudgment? I can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the contrary, but that it pleaſeth not our Miniſters to haue it ſo: indeede they talke much that the Sabbath it was a ſigne, the Sabbath it was a ſigne, and now the body Chriſt being come, the ſigne muſt of neceſſity be gone, but here they ſee the contrary, the <hi>ſigne</hi> of the Paſſeouer it laſted in the Church, many hundreth of yeers after the thing <hi>ſignified</hi> by it was come.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Circumciſion, it was a ſigne, that God would giue the Land of Canaan, to the Iſraelites Geneſ. 17.4.8.10. well then, <hi>Canaan</hi> was the thing ſignified by the ſigne of <hi>circumciſion:</hi> now when the Iſraelites were come into the Land of Canaan, then they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the thing ſignified; but did not this ſigne of circumciſion, laſt in the Church, many hundreth yeers after that? yis, euen to the coming of Chriſt; for he was circumciſed: and why may, not the Sabbath (if a ſigne) remaine ſtill in the Church after Chriſts death? if they ſay, that circumciſion was a ſigne of ſomething elſe beſids the Land of Canaan; ſo ſay I was the Sabbath; for it was a ſigne alſo of the <hi>creation,</hi> or of Gods reſt then Exod. 31.17.</p>
                     <p>A 3d inſtance: The Lord gaue <hi>Moſes</hi> a ſigne or token, that hee had ſent him to deliuer the Iſralites; now the ſigne was this, that after he had brought the Iſraelites out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> both hee &amp; they ſhould ſerue God vpon the Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> Exod. 3.1.12. where you ſee, that the ſigne, was a good while after that the thing ſignified was come: for the thing ſignified was this, that Moſes ſhould goe vnto Pharaoh and alſo bring the children of Iſrael out of Egypt, Exod. 3.11. now after hee had bene with Pharaoh, &amp; after he had carried the Iſralites out of Egypt, then was the ſigne not aboliſhed, but to be vſed: An other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of like kind, we find in Iſa. 7.14. you may ſee it at your leiſure: by all which inſtances this one thing appeareth, that a ſigne may remaine, lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g after the thing ſignified by it be come, &amp; thus is their 3d argument anſwered.</p>
                     <p>Oh, how doe theſe men loue the <hi>Law</hi> of God? who thus diſpute againſt it? and what would be the iſſue, if they could
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:21140:188"/>obtaine their deſires? why this, Gods <hi>Law</hi> ſhould become A <hi>Monſtre:</hi> &amp; we <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> ſhould become <hi>Anabaptistes,</hi> &amp; profane perſones, kepeing no Sabbaths at all, for beſides this Sabbath, they ſhall neuer be able to ſhew vs any other.</p>
                     <p>Hauing anſwered to all that they can ſay out of this text, &amp; to euery argument ſeuerally, now I come to giue iij. anſwers more, which may ſerue to euery of their 3. arguments: but firſt I deſire my aduerſaries, either to imbrace theſe my <hi>anſwers,</hi> and <hi>diſtinctiones,</hi> whereby I would <hi>preſerue</hi> Gods Sabbaths, or elſe to ſtudy ſuch others, as may pleaſe them better; or elſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray abhominable <hi>partiallity</hi> to Gods Law &amp; trueth: for they cane preſerue nyne commandements, &amp; halfe of the 4th, &amp; why not the other halfe, &amp; ſo all the tenn intirely?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, whereas they take it for granted, that the Sabbath here mentioned, Exo. 31.13. which they ſay is made a ſigne of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, that it is the 7th day Sabbath, mentioned in the 4th com. this I deny: there are ii. ſortes of Sabbaths, the weekly 7th day Sabbath; &amp; the yeerly Sabbaths: now this their text, may be vnderſtod of the Annuall and yeerly Sabbaths, which neuer came into the Morall Law: if therefore I ſhall make it appeare, that this text of theirs, may be vnderſtod of the Annuall and <hi>ceremoniall</hi> Sabbathes, and not of the <hi>morall,</hi> weekly Sabbath; then is all their labour loſt, and all their 3 arguments friuolouſe; for all their arguments haue argued onely againſt the yeerly <hi>ceremoniall</hi> Sabbaths, the which no man will defend; for this purpoſe therefore, note theſe things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is very improbable, that all thoſe verſes v. 13.14.15.16.17. which are 5 in number, ſhould treate but of one kind of Sabbath, to wit, the 7th day Sabbath, as may appeare by the very reading of them ouer, vnleſſe you would ſay here were a Tautologie, ouer and ouer againe with the ſame thinge. Wherefore it is more probable, that in this long and large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Sabbaths, Moſes ſpeaketh of ij ſortes of Sabbaths, of the yeerly Sabbaths in Exod. 31.13.14. and of the weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in Exod. 31.15.16.17. ſome light is added herevnto, if we doe but obſerue Moſes; for he vſeth often in ſpeaking of the Sabbath, to mention both kinds before he hath done, that
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:21140:188"/>is, both the anniuerſary Sabbaths, and the weekly Sabbath, as you may ſee in Exod. 23.12.14.15.16. and in Exod. 34.21.22.23. and in Leuit. 23.3.4.24.32.38.39.</p>
                     <p>A 2d reaſon may be this; the Lord had giuen Moſes in charge to build the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> Exod. 25.8.9. the making whereof, would coſt greate &amp; longe labour; now leaſt the people ſhould thinke, that becauſe the worke about this Tabernacle, was an holy worke, perteyning vnto God, for his ſeruice and worſhip, that therefore they might put no difference of dayes, whilſt they were in this worke, but that they might worke vpon the Sabbaths alſo, whither weekly Sabbaths, or yeerly Sabbaths, as well as on the 6 working dayes; to preuent this, <hi>Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (ſaith the Lord) my Sabbaths yee ſhall keepe &amp;c.</hi> Exod. 31.13. &amp;c. as if the Lord had ſaid, albeit I will that you make me A Tabernacle &amp;c. Yet I will not, that you worke about it on my Sabbath dayes; now becauſe the people, were as prone, vpon this occation of building the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> to worke vpon the yeerly Sabbaths when their turne came, as vpon the weekly Sabbath, on the 7th day, therfore it is meete for vs to thinke, that God would as well make <hi>prouiſion</hi> heere, for his yeerly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, as for the weekly Sabbath: and that therefore in this text Exod. 31. Moſes ſpake of the yeerly Sabbaths, as in v. 13.14. and of the weekly Sabbath, as in v. 15.16.17. that ſo the people appointed to worke about the Tabcrnacle, as Bezaleel and Aboliab and the reſt, they might not worke, either vpon the yeerly or weekly Sabbath: but were all theſe 5 verſes ſpent onely about one kind of Sabbath, as the weekly Sabbath onely, then had not God made <hi>proviſion</hi> heere for his yeerly Sabbaths, which cannot be likly.</p>
                     <p>A third reaſon may be this, that in theſe fewe verſes v. 13.14.15.16.17. there is threatened the puniſhment of <hi>death,</hi> to thoſe that doe any worke on the Sabbath, two ſeuerall times, &amp; in two ſeuerall verſes, as in v. 14. whoſoeuer worketh therein, <hi>the ſame perſon ſhall be cut of from his people:</hi> and in v. 15. who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer doth any worke in the Sabbath day, <hi>ſhall dye the death.</hi> Now it is not likly, that one and the ſame puniſhment ſhould be repeated, and twiſe together threatened, for the breach of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:21140:189"/>one kinde of Sabbath day: and therefore to auoid a Tautologie and needleſſe repetition, it is moſt likly that here Moſes ſpake of two kinds of Sabbaths, of the yeerly Sabbath in v. 13. and ſo threatened death to the tranſgreſſoures of them in v. 14. and of the weekly Sabbath in v. 15. and ſo threatened death alſo to the tranſgreſſours of it, in the latter end of the ſame v. 15.</p>
                     <p>A 4th reaſon may be this, that the Sabbaths in v. 13.14. are made a ſigne of Sanctification or Redemption by Chriſt, as they ſay; but the Sabbath in v. 15.16.17. is kept in memory of the Creation, and is a ſigne of Creation, to remember, that in 6 dayes the Lord made beauen and earth, and reſted on the 7th day, as you haue it in v. 17. now theſe diuerſe ſignes doe inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that here may be diuerſe Sabbaths ſpoken of in theſe verſes: for, Sanctification and Redemption may be applied to the one kind, and Creation to the other kind of Sabbaths: for, it is nothing probable, that Redemption and Creation, ſhould be both applied vnto one kind onely.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee what liklihod there is, that the Sabbaths men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in v. 13. vpon which they grownd all their arguments, are not the 7th day Sabbath, which is our queſtion; but that they are the yeerly Sabbaths, which neuer came into the morall law, and about which we make no queſtion at all: wherefore, vnleſſe they cane take away theſe anſwers, and proue vnto v. that by the word <hi>Sabbathes</hi> in v. 13. is meante the <hi>weekly</hi> 7. day Sabbath, they are beſids the queſtion; all their labour hath bene in vaine, and all being granted them which this text cane afford them, it will make onely for the aboliſhing of the yeerly Sabbaths, but nothing for the aboliſhing of the 7th day Sabbath: for, ſuppoſe it granted, that the yeerly Sabbaths, in v. 13.14. were ſignes of Sanctification, and Redemption by Chriſt, and therefore aboliſhed; yet it will not follow, that the weekly Sabbath in v. 15.16.17. which was kept in memory of the Creation, and was a ſigne, that God created the world v. 17. muſt alſo be aboliſhed, and ſo much for the formoſt of my generall anſwers.</p>
                     <p>My other generall anſwer to this text, Exod. 31.13 and te all their arguments hence deduced is this; ſuppoſe we that be
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:21140:189"/>the word Sabbathes in v. 13. is meante the 7th day Sabbath, yet it followeth not that becauſe it is made a ſigne, or a ſigne of Chriſt, that therefore the Sabbath day muſt be aboliſhed: for, we muſt know, that the <hi>ſigne</hi> of the Sabbath may vaniſh, &amp; yet the <hi>Sabbath</hi> may remaine ſtill: for the cleering of this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with me, that the Sabbath may be conſidered <hi>aboſolutly</hi> or <hi>relatiuly:</hi> abſolutly without any ſigne, or relatiuly with its ſigne: like as an Iuey buſh or the like ſigne hung vp at a Vinete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners houſe; you may conſider its abſolute nature, as it is no ſigne, but as it is an Iuey buſh onely; &amp; you may conſider it relatiuely, as it it is a ſigne that wyne is to be ſould at that houſe; &amp; theſe two may be parted; for take downe the Iuey buſh, &amp; then it is no longer a ſigne, it hath loſt its relatiue nature, but yet it is a buſh ſtill, ſo it retaineth its abſolute nature: &amp; thus the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, it hath an abſolute nature, &amp; it hath a relatiue &amp; ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatiue nature, now theſe two may be parted; for it may leeſe its relatiue nature as a <hi>ſigne,</hi> &amp; yet retaine its abſolute nature as a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> iuſt as in the ſimilitude of the Iuey buſh.</p>
                     <p>But here happily ſome may aske of me, what it is which I cale the abſolute nature of the Sabbath, &amp; what the relatiue nature: To whome I anſwer, I count that to be the abſolute nature of the Sabbath, which is not conſidered typically relatiuly, &amp; ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatiuly, euen all, that is to be conſidered <hi>in</hi> the Sabbath, ouer &amp; beſids its typicall &amp; ſignificatiue nature, that is its abſolute inature: more particularly, the abſolute nature of the Sabbath, tis an holy reſt, vpon the 7th day, becauſe God reſted vpon the 7th day, and all this, as commanded by God: in which abſolute nature, are compriſed theſe particulars, 1. a reſt from laboures, 2. a performance of ſacred and holy actiones. 3. that both theſe be done on the 7th day: 4. that theſe three be done in imitation of God, becauſe God reſted on the ſame day, &amp; bleſſed it, and ſanctified it, Exod. 20.11. fiftly, that all theſe be ſo done, becauſe God commanded them, Exod. 20.8.10. theſe 5. things are the abſolute nature of the Sabbath: now for the relatiue nature of the Sabbath, it is whatſoeuer is added vnto theſe 5. things ſignificatiuly, to ſigne &amp; ſignifie any thing; thus the Sabbath
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:21140:190"/>was made a <hi>ſigne</hi> of the <hi>Creation</hi> &amp; of Gods Reſt on the 7th day, at the worlds creation, Exod. 31.17. &amp; thus was the Sabbath made a <hi>ſigne</hi> alſo of the <hi>Redemption,</hi> or of Chriſts ſanctification of vs, as they would haue it out, of Exod. 31.13. which being ſuppoſed, the Sabbath had a double relatiue nature, the one to ſignify the Creation as paſt; the other to ſignify the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Chriſt as to come: (which double ſigne being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, my inſueing inſtances, might be a litle more diſtinctly carried, but as they are, it may ſuffice to giue you a taſte) and thus you haue the abſolute nature of the Sabbath declared, and alſo its relatiue or typicall nature.</p>
                     <p>I come now to ſhew, that the Sabbath may leeſe its <hi>typicall</hi> nature, &amp; yet it may retaine its <hi>abſolute</hi> nature: &amp; firſt I ſhall giue you inſtances, where things had a double type or ſigne, &amp; the one of them vaniſheing, neuertheleſſe the thing was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſtill, with a reſpect vnto the other ſigne that remained.</p>
                     <p>The firſt inſtance for this purpoſe, ſhall be that Sacrament of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered as vſed, after the children of Iſrael were come into the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> &amp; here we are to note, that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion typed out two things; the one was, that God would giue vnto the Iſraelites the land of Canaan, Geneſ. 17.8. the other was, that God would make Abraham a father of many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones, Gen. 17.7.4. &amp; that God would be God vnto Abraham &amp; to his ſeede after him, Geneſ. 17.7. now after that the <hi>Iſralits</hi> the poſterity of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were come into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp; did inherit it, then was one of theſe things typed out by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion fulfilled, &amp; then was circumciſion to looſe its relatiue &amp; ſignificatiue nature, as typing out Canaan to come, for it was come, &amp; they were in it; &amp; yet this <hi>ſigne</hi> of circumciſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill in the Church, for many hundreth yeers, &amp; that as hauing reference vnto the other thing typed out by it, to wit, that God would be God vnto the ſeede of Abraham, &amp; that hee ſhould be a father of many nationes: thus you ſee, the action of <hi>circumciſion</hi> remained in the Church ſtill, when one of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>types was come: &amp; why then may not the duty of the Sabbath day, remaine ſtill in the Church, after one of its antitypes be come; ſo long as an other of its antitypes is ſtill in force? admit,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:21140:190"/>the Sabbath was a ſigne of Chriſt to come, and ſo therefore it be no more kept as a type of Chriſt to come; yet may it ſtill be kept in the Church, and ſo for euer, as a type or <hi>ſigne</hi> of the <hi>Creation:</hi> for our ages, and ſo all poſterity vnto the worlds end, may as well keepe the Sabbath as a ſigne of the Creation, as the Iewes and people of God did at any time: Why may not the <hi>Sabbath</hi> be retained, for one of its antitypes ſake, as well as <hi>circumciſion</hi> was retained for one of its antitypes ſake?</p>
                     <p>A ſecond inſtance for this purpoſe, ſhall be that other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>Paſſeouer,</hi> conſidered as it was vſed after the Angel had ſmitten dead the firſt borne of the Egyptians, and paſſed by the houſen of the Iſralites: and here we are to note as before, that the Paſſeouer was a type or ſigne of two things, the one was, that God would paſſe ouer the houſen of the children of Iſraels, &amp; ſpare them, when at midnight he would deſtroy others. Exod, 12.11.12.13. The other was, that it was a ſigne of Chriſt our Paſſeouer. 1. Cor. 5.7. Now after that the Angell had deſtroyed the firſt borne of the Egyptians, &amp; ſpared the Iſralites, then one of the <hi>types</hi> of the Paſſeouer was fulfilled; neuertheleſſe, the Paſſeouer was retained in the Church for many hundreth yeeres after; and this was becauſe of the other <hi>type</hi> which was not then fulfilled:</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Paſſeouer cold not be a ſigne, vnto thoſe <hi>Proſelytes</hi> who ioyned to the Iewiſh religion, when they were in <hi>Canaan,</hi> of their deliuerance from the deſtroying Angell, who ſmote all the firſt borne of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and yet it remained as a ſigne to them, of <hi>Chriſt</hi> their Paſſeouer to come: theſe Proſelite Gentiles left the Iewes, in that which was proper and <hi>peculiar</hi> vnto the Iew, that is, to vſe the Paſſeouer as it was a ſigne of deliuerance obtained by the Iewes onely in Egypt, and ioyned with them in the vſe of the Paſſeouer as it was a ſigne of Chriſt the <hi>common</hi> Paſſeouer for Iew &amp; Gentile both; ſee Exod. 12.25.26.27. Now ſuppoſe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was a ſigne of Chriſt, and therefore aboliſhed in that reſpect, when Chriſt came; yet why may it not remaine ſtill, in that other reſpect, as it is a <hi>ſigne</hi> of the <hi>Creation?</hi> if it was ſo with the <hi>Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,</hi> it may be ſo with the <hi>Sabbath day:</hi> and, if thoſe Proſelites who were Gentiles, did obſerue the Paſſeouer, neglecting ſuch
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:21140:191"/>things therein as were <hi>peculiar</hi> vnto the Iewes, imbracing ſuch things onely as were <hi>common</hi> to the Iewes and Gentiles both, why may not wee <hi>Gentiles,</hi> lay aſide the typicall quality of the Sabbath, wherein it was <hi>peculiar</hi> vnto the Iewes, &amp; imbrace the Sabbath in other reſpectes; and as a ſigne of the Creation, vvherein it vvas <hi>common</hi> both to Iew and to Gentile?</p>
                     <p>I come now to giue you inſtances of ſignes, vvhere <hi>all</hi> the typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call &amp; relatiue nature is aboliſhed, and the abſolute nature remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtill. 1. The <hi>Rocke</hi> in the vvilderneſſe, its abſolute nature was to be of a ſtony ſubſtance &amp;c. And its vſe, for men to vvaſh and beaſtes to drink at: Now this Rocke vvas made a ſigne of Chriſt: For, <hi>they dranke of the ſpirituall Rocke that followed them, and the Rocke was Chriſt.</hi> 1. Cor. 10.4. ſo this Rocke vvas a Sacrament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſigne: now vvhen Chriſt vvas come (if not longe before) this Rocke ceaſed to be a ſigne of Chriſt any longer, and ſo it loſt its relatiue and ſignificatiue nature; but yet it ceaſed not to be a Rocke ſtill, and of a ſtonie ſubſtance &amp;c. And to be vſefull for men to vvaſh and beaſts to drink at, it kept its abſolute nature: and ſo, if the Sabbath be no longer <hi>a ſigne,</hi> yet it may be a <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſtill, and all thoſe 5 dueties which are the abſolute nature, forementioned, they may remaine ſtill: ſuppoſe therefore that they could proue, that all ſignes are aboliſhed, or that all ſignes of Chriſt are aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, yet it vvould neuer follow, that the Sabbath is aboliſhed, any further forth then as it vvas a ſigne; it could leeſe but its relatiue and typicall quality, like as the Iuey buſh doth, vvhen it is pulled downe; then it is no longer a ſigne, but a buſh it is ſtill; and ſo a Sabbath it is ſtill; for its abſolute nature may remaine ſtill, to vvit, 1. Its reſt 2. its holy performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, 3. On the 7th day. 4. Becauſe God did theſe things, on the ſame day. 5. Becauſe God comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them.</p>
                     <p>A 2d inſtance may be this, the <hi>Bridgroome</hi> vvas made a type of Chriſt, as vve reade euery vvhere in the booke of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> &amp; Ioh. 3.29. Reuel. 19.7. ſo the <hi>Shepheard</hi> vvas made a ſigne of Chriſt Ioh. 10.11. and yet the death of Chriſt, hath not aboliſhed theſe relationes; for vve haue Bridgroomes and Shepheards ſtill.</p>
                     <p>A 3d inſtance may be that of <hi>forbidden meates:</hi> vve reade of certaine meates forbidden to be eaten by the law, as vncleane Leuit. 11.5.6.7. as the <hi>Cony,</hi> the <hi>Hare,</hi> and the <hi>Swine:</hi> now theſe
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:21140:191"/>were made ſignes and Shaddowes of Chriſt, Col. 2.16.17. But Chriſt being come, theſe beaſtes ceaſed to be vncleane, and to be ſignes of Chriſt any longer Act. 10.14.15.12.13. Col. 2.16.17. ſo, then they loſt their ſignificatiue nature, but yet the ſame beaſtes loſt not their abſolute nature ſo ſoone as Chriſt was come; for theſe beaſtes were the ſame in nature and kind the which they were before, the Hare was an Hare ſtill, the Cony a Cony ſtill &amp;c. And why may it not be ſo with the Sabbath day alſo? it may be a Sabbath, though not a typicall Sabbath: or, the fleſh of the Hare, Cony, and Swine, may ſtill be refrained, in a <hi>politicall</hi> reſpect, as in <hi>Lent</hi> time; or in a <hi>Religiouſe</hi> reſpect, as in a <hi>faſting day:</hi> and why then may not the Sabbath day be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as a ſigne? and yet remaine ſtill, as a ſacred time for Gods worſhip? for the <hi>forbearance</hi> of theſe meates, was as much a type, as euer was the Sabbath day, &amp; yet we may and doe forbeare them ſtill: why then I ſay may we not ſtill retaine the Sabbath, albeit it was a type? may we not aſwell <hi>obſerue</hi> the Sabbath now, which was a type, as <hi>forbeare</hi> thoſe meates now, which forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was a type?</p>
                     <p>Here I muſt craue leaue of my reader, to make a ſhort digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by way of defence of this laſt inſtance; you ſee I cale the <hi>Swine</hi> a ſhaddow of Chriſt: this phraſe is exceedingly diſtaſted of ſome: by name <hi>M. Chappel,</hi> vndertaking to confute ſome things in my former booke publikly, tooke hold of this for one, and in reprochfull manner ſaid, this <hi>Author</hi> makes the <hi>Swine</hi> a ſigne of Chriſt, <hi>a Swineiſh argument,</hi> quoth hee: which check was receiued by his auditory with greate applauſe, inſomuch as it hath bene runge in myne eares, &amp; caſt in my teeth ſondry times, by diuerſe men, what a ſwineiſh argument, I vſed: now for the cleering of my ſelfe, ſee my former booke on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, at pag. 146. where I did affirme the ſwine to be <hi>a Shaddow of Christ,</hi> &amp; I proued it there by Leuit. 11.5.6.7. Col. 2.16.17. now that it is ſo, this text of S. Pauls will beare me out; for hee ſaith that <hi>meate</hi> was a <hi>ſhaddow</hi> of things to come, but the body is of Chriſt: where S. Paul maketh meates to be ſhaddowes of Chriſt, as well as holy daies, new moones, &amp; Sabbaths, as you may ſee in the text: now what meates, were ſhaddowes, but
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:21140:192"/>the prohibited meates, forbidden to be eaten vnder the Law? &amp; what meates find you in the Law forbidden to be eaten, but theſe the <hi>Hare,</hi> the <hi>Cony,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Swine,</hi> as you may read Leuit. 11.5.6.7. ſo then, theſe forbidden meates, the Hare, the Cony, &amp; the Swine, were theſe which Paul counteth to be ſhaddowes of Chriſt: why then M. Chappell, may not I haue leaue to ſay, the Swine was a ſhadow of Chriſt, as well as S. Paul? &amp; why ſhould you make me a ſcorne, and a bye word, vnto your audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, &amp; diſdained in the minds of honeſt and well minded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? for ought I can ſee you might aſwell haue ſaid the ſame words reprochfully of S. Paul, as of me, taxing him to haue vſed a <hi>Swiniſh argument:</hi> This your errour M. Chappell is by ſo much the greater, in that when you vttered theſe words, you preached out of this very text, the which I vſed in my booke, to proue that the Swine amongſt the reſt, was a Shaddow of Chriſt, to wit, Col. 2.16.17. now had you but well &amp; rightly vnderſtod your owne text out of which you then preached, you would neuer haue accuſed me for vſeing of a Swiniſh argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. for it is your very text, that beareth me out in caling the Hare, Cony, &amp; Swine ſhaddowes of Chriſt: and ſo I returne whence I came.</p>
                     <p>A 4th inſtance ſhall be that which my aduerſaries will aſſent vnto: for they ſay the Reſt in the Sabbath day, is a <hi>type</hi> of the reft in the Kingdome of Heauen, Heb. 4. &amp; a <hi>ſigne</hi> of Chriſt, Exod. 31.13. Col. 2.16. &amp; yet they hold the ſame <hi>Reſt</hi> to be <hi>morall</hi> &amp; ſtill in force: &amp; why then may not the 7th day, be aboliſhed as a type, and yet remaine as a ſacred time for Gods worſhip, &amp; as a time to exerciſe mercy in towards poore ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, by releaſing them from their laboures wherein they haue bene ſpent the 6. daies before? why I ſay may not the time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſtill, as it is an helpe and a furtherance vnto thoſe morall dueties of reſt, &amp; the worſhip of God? it is to be wondered at, to ſee men goe about to reiect &amp; aboliſh ſuch things as were, are in themſelues, and may be helpes &amp; furtherances of Morall dueties.</p>
                     <p>A 5th inſtance ſhall be the feaſt of <hi>Pentecost</hi> or <hi>Whit-Sunday,</hi> which was a Iewiſh feaſt day or Sabbath day, as you may read
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:21140:192"/>in Leuit. 23.15.16.21. &amp; it was alſo a ſigne, or <hi>Shadow</hi> of Chriſt to come, as you may ſee, Col. 2.16.17. &amp; ſo it was aboliſhed: neuertheleſſe, we <hi>Christians</hi> doe keepe this feaſt day, &amp; ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it as a Sabbath day once euery yeere; for as Peter did preach vpon the day of Pentecoſt, Act. 2.1.14. ſo doeth our Church vpon <hi>Whit-ſunday;</hi> onely we haue caſt of that ſhaddowiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which it had amongſt the Iewes, of being a <hi>ſigne</hi> of Chriſt to come: wherefore, by the conſtant practiſe of our Church, it appeareth, that a Iewiſh <hi>ceremoniall</hi> day, may be retained in our Church, ſo be the ceremonies of it be reiected: if then pentecoſt, a ceremoniall feaſt or Sabbath day, may be retained in a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church, why may not the 7th day Sabbath alſo be retained amongſt vs? yea if it could be proued a ſigne of Chriſt to come: thus by this inſtance you ſee, that a <hi>Sabbath day</hi> may remaine, after its <hi>ſignificatiue</hi> nature or quality be vaniſhed.</p>
                     <p>Thus I haue finiſhed my two generall anſwers, the former, ſhewing that the 7th day Sabbath, is not ſpoken of in their text, Exod. 31.13. but onely the yeerly Sabbaths: the latter, ſhewing that if the 7th day Sabbath were ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of in their text, Ex. 31.13 yet no more is aboliſhed of this Sabbath, but its ſignificatiue &amp; typicall quality; but the abſolute nature of the Sabbath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of thoſe 5 things foreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, may ſtill remaine, to wit, 1. reſt, 2. holy dueties, 3. on the 7th day, 4. becauſe God reſted on this 7th day, &amp; ſanctified it. 5. becauſe God commanded theſe thinges.</p>
                     <p>My third generall anſwer (that I may defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the morall Law, with euery thing therin commanded vnto a <hi>iot</hi> and <hi>title;</hi> and ſhune thoſe foule and many abſurdeties, which my aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries rune into) is this: the Sabbath may be conſidered <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> &amp; <hi>orginally,</hi> &amp; ſo I deny it was any <hi>ſigne:</hi> for the ſigne was not put into the 4th com. much leſſe to its firſt inſtitution, Gen. 2.3. or it may be conſidered <hi>accidentally</hi> &amp; <hi>aduentitiouſly,</hi> and ſo it became a <hi>ſigne</hi> after its inſtitution, as in Exod. 31.13. ſo as the ſigne, was but <hi>accidentall</hi> and <hi>extrinſecall</hi> to the Sabbath; it being added to it many hundreth yeeres after its prime <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;</hi> and I know not how long after its <hi>promulgation</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinay:</hi> in this latter ſenſe I yeeld it aboliſhed, but in the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:21140:193"/>former, I deny it: for as the <hi>Rocke</hi> after it loſt its typicalneſſe, it ſtill remained a Rocke; ſo may the Sabbath; after Chriſt had aboliſhed its typicalneſſe, which was <hi>affixed</hi> to it, it may ſtill remaine a Sabbath, as it was <hi>originally</hi> at its prime inſtitution; it may remaine ſtill, as a Sacred time for Gods worſhip, &amp; as a fit time to refreſh ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; beaſt in, ſpent with former 6 daies labour.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for anſwer vnto this their text, Exod. 31.13. wherein we haue bene the larger, becauſe they ſtand ſo much vpon it, as one of their ſtrongeſt fortes and ſuereſt houldes, but how weake you ſee: there remaineth now but one text more of theirs to anſwer, and it is a maine and chiefe one alſo, it followeth in this next ſection.</p>

                     <p>The firſt abſurdety is this, that they doe voluntarily &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, without any conſtraint, ſet themſelues in oppoſition, to an <hi>ancient ordinance</hi> of Gods in his Church: for this purpoſe, it is to be obſerued, not onely that the Saturday, or 7th day Sabbath, was an ordinance of Gods, and in high honour in his Church; but alſo that it was one of the moſt ancient ordinances, that euer God eſtabliſhed in his Church: for this Sabbath day, it did not onely obtaine like priuiledges, and honour equally, with the reſidue of the Morales, deliuered vpon Mount Sinay; but alſo, it pleaſed God to Sanctify this day at the very Creation of the world, as we reade Geneſ. 2.3. <hi>So God bleſſed the 7th day &amp; ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified it:</hi> God did ſanctifie this day, &amp; reſted in it, making him ſelfe our preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>begining</hi> this holy Sabbath in his owne perſon: now for any man to oppoſe any of Gods ordinances, wilfully &amp;
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:21140:193"/>not compelled therevnto is an euill, but to oppoſe ſo ancient an ordinance as is this Sabbath, is a farre greater euill: <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and the <hi>Lords ſupper,</hi> are ancient ordinances in the Church, yet are they nothing ſo ancient, as be the <hi>Lords Sabbaths:</hi> whereby you ſee, that theſe patrones of <hi>nouelty</hi> are enemies to <hi>antiquity;</hi> I meane, thoſe who defend the Lords day for a Sabbath, which is a nouill thing, they are enemies to the Sabbath day, which is a moſt ancient thing: were it ſome nouelty, or new vpſtart point in religion, which I ſpeake for, it were tollerable that they ſhould oppoſe it; but being ſo ancient an ordinance in Gods Church, as that it is backed with the greateſt antiquity; here to oppoſe, &amp; that cauſleſly, is moſt abſurd.</p>
                     <p>Were they compelled herevnto or conſtrained, by the vrgeing neceſſity of <hi>ſome</hi> portion of Scripture in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or more ſpecially, were they compelled herevnto by this one text of Scripture Col. 2.16.17. or by any thing therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, they might be excuſed: but ſeing this text, as well as all others, may be ſo expounded, as it ſhall not any whit oppoſe this ancient Sabbath and ordinance of God; and ſeing there is no collection or conſequence, that is thence deduced againſt this ordinance of Gods, which neceſſarily muſt follow from this text, therefore they are altogether vnexcuſable that oppoſe it, &amp; make it ſo odiouſe before the people of God.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore their abſurdety appeareth, partly in this, that they will oppoſe an ordinance of Gods; yea one of his moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ordinances eſtabliſhed in his Church: and partly in this, that they will ſet themſelues againſt the ſame, voluntarily and wilfully, for no cauſe at all, but becauſe they will doe ſo.</p>

                     <p>A 3d abſurdety, commited by theſe is this; that they foulely contradict themſelues, by bringing this text Col. 2.16.17. againſt the Lords Sabbath day: for, whereas the queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and mee, is ſolely about the time and <hi>day,</hi> to wit, the 7th day, this their text which they bring againſt this day, it doth not ſo much as mention they word <hi>day</hi> at all; for the word <hi>dayes</hi> in the text Col. 2.16.17. it is not in the originall, as you may perceiue by this, that our tranſlatoures haue written it in ſmaler letters; the originall hath nothing but the word <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths:</hi> whereby I gather, that rather the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> then the word day, and the time, are made a ſhaddow of Chriſt: now the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word Sabbath, ſignifying a Reſt from labours, as they will haue it: if any thing therefore be a ſhaddow of Chriſt, it is this <hi>Reſt</hi> from laboures: now they all teach and maintaine, that the Reſt in the 4th com. is morall and perpetuall, and yet behold here, by this their text Col. 2.16.17. and by their argument out of it, they diſpute againſt this Sabbath or Reſt; for they make it a ſhaddow of Chriſt, and ſo aboliſhed; and ſo this Reſt, it ſhall be morall &amp; ceremoniall; perpetuall, and yet long ſince aboliſhed: it ſhall be morall, by their <hi>Doctrine</hi> in the <hi>pulpit,</hi> and ceremoniall by their <hi>arguments</hi> in <hi>Diſputation:</hi> is not this a groſſe contradiction? for this text Col. 2.16. if it maketh any thing againſt the 7th day Sabbath, it maketh as much (if not more)
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:21140:194"/>againſt the word Sabbath and Reſt, as it doth againſt the day and time, which is the thing in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>And this I make plaine by this reaſon alſo; they ſay, that by the word <hi>Sabbaths</hi> in Col. 2.16.17. is meant all Sabbaths, both the weekly and the yeerly Sabbaths; which if it be ſo, then looke how largly the word Sabbaths, is expounded touching the yeerly Sabbaths, ſo largly this word Sabbaths muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded touching the weekly Sabbath. for this one word (Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathes) cannot be taken in ij diuerſe ſenſes: now this word, in reference vnto the yeerly Sabbaths, doth includ both the time &amp; <hi>day,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Rest</hi> &amp; <hi>dueties</hi> to be performed in that time and day, and ſo all are aboliſhed as Shaddowes, both the Reſt, and the <hi>day:</hi> iuſt ſo it muſt be touching the weekly Sabbath, if it be meant in the word <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> then both the <hi>day</hi> and the <hi>Reſt</hi> of the day alſo, muſt be included, and ſo <hi>day,</hi> and <hi>Rest,</hi> muſt be aboliſhed, as ſhaddowes both?</p>
                     <p>A 4th abſurdety committed by theſe enemies to the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and integrity of Gods law, is this, that by bringing this text Col. 2.16.17. (or any other text or textes) againſt the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, commanded in the 4th com. hereby they doe nullify &amp; vtterly bring to naught the 4th com. for, whereas the 4th com. commandeth the Sanctification of the <hi>Sabbath day;</hi> theſe men will by this text, proue this <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> to be a Shaddow of Chriſt, and ſo therefore to be aboliſhed: whence it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that by their doeings the Sabbath day, commanded in the 4th com, is aboliſhed as a ſhaddow, which being aboliſhed the 4th com. is nullified, and made as a cipher, it commanding iuſt nothing at all: for, if theſe words <hi>(Sabbath day)</hi> be a ſhaddow and aboliſhed, then theſe 10 letters which are in theſe 2 words, may in ſenſe be put away as aboliſhed, and in the roome of them put 10 ciphers: then whereas the 4th com. runeth thus; <hi>Remember the (Sabbath day) to ſanctify it:</hi> why now according to theſe patrones of the Lords day, it may rune thus, <hi>Remember the 0000000000, to ſanctify it:</hi> and thus they haue nullified this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; for you ſee it now commandeth iuſt nothing; vnleſſe they can tell how to proue vnto vs, by the virtue of their conſequences, that God commanded two Sabbath dayes
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:21140:195"/>in his 4th com. the one vpon the 7th day, the other vpon the 8th day: ſuer I am, the <hi>Iewes</hi> neuer knew but one, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> neuer kept but one, and <hi>God</hi> ſpake not in his 4th com. of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, in the plurall number, but of a Sabbath, or the Sabbath, in the ſingular number, as but of one ſingularly, and this one Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, they haue made a Shaddow, and ſo aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Finally, whereas <hi>all Diuines</hi> affirme, that <hi>ſome time or day</hi> in generall for Gods worſhip, is morall and in force by the 4th com. if this text Col. 2.16. be vrged againſt the time and day, to wit, the Sabbath day, in the 4th com. then this abſurdety alſo followeth, that there is not <hi>ſome time or day</hi> for Gods worſhip, morall by the 4th com. the reaſon is, becauſe looke what was commanded in the 4th com. vnder theſe words <hi>(Sabbath day)</hi> the ſelfeſame is a boliſhed by Col. 2.16. vnder the ſame words <hi>(Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes)</hi> if this text be ſet againſt that: for theſe words muſt haue as large a ſenſe in Col. 2.16. as they haue in Exod. 20.8. and ſo we ſhall haue no time morall in the 4th com. for Gods worſhip, which is contrary to all Diuines.</p>
                     <p>A 5th abſurdety, which theſe enemies of the perfection and integrity of Gods law, doe fale into, by producing this text Col. 2.16.17, (or any other text) againſt the 7th day Sabbath, commanded in the morall law, is this, that they doe ſet Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture together by the eares, as they ſay; they make by their col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiones and by their conſequences, one text of Scripture, to be at mortall warres with an other; &amp; one text quite to ouerthrow and ouerturne an other; for example, the 4th com. it comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Sanctification of the 7th day Sabbath, in moſt plaine and expreſſe words, and yet for all that, they dare attempt to gather collectiones and conſequences, out of an other text of Scripture, to wit, Col. 2.16.17. whereby they will aboliſh and nullify vtterly that very thing, which was commanded in the 4th com. in expreſſe termes: is not this, to ſet Scripture at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance with Scripture, and one text againſt an other?</p>
                     <p>It is the parte of all Miniſters to loue Gods law, and to their beſt to defend it, as the <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Charter</hi> of their Soueraigne Lord God: and for this end, they ſhould labour and ſtudy, to <hi>reconcile</hi> ſuch texts in the new Teſtament, as ſeeme to oppoſe
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:21140:195"/>any thing comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the morall law: but theſe are farre from <hi>reconciling,</hi> who ſtudy to ſet the <hi>Law</hi> &amp; <hi>Goſpell</hi> at oddes: I appeale vnto their conſciences, if euer they faithfull attempted, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile</hi> theſe two textes Exod. 20.8.10. &amp; Col. 2.16.</p>
                     <p>Nay which is yet worſe, not this Scripture Col. 2.16.17. is ſet in oppoſition, againſt this Scripture Exod. 20.8. but their <hi>collectiones</hi> and <hi>conſequences,</hi> fetched out of this Scripture Col. 2.16.17. by manes ſhallow <hi>reaſon,</hi> is ſet in higheſt oppoſition againſt this other Scripture Exod. 20.8. But for a bare collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſequence, framed by mans poreblind and feeble reaſon, that this ſhould put to <hi>perpetuall</hi> ſilence, an <hi>expreſſe</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, a portion of Gods written <hi>word</hi> and <hi>will;</hi> yea ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne an <hi>ordinance</hi> of Gods, commanded in his morall law; then this, there can be no greater abſurdety, no greater impiety: for this is to ſet mans reaſon, and conſequence, in equall Throne with the moſt Higheſt: for mans reaſon ſhall be a <hi>Countermand,</hi> to Gods expreſſe <hi>commandement:</hi> yea, it ſhall take the vpper hand of God; for it ſhall be more forcible, to ouerturne Gods commandement, then is Gods commandement forcible, to gaineſay mans reaſon and conſequence: if this be not <hi>blaſphemy</hi> againſt the moſt Higheſt, let all men iudge: and whither the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe, hath more highly aduanced his <hi>Authority,</hi> aboue the Scriptures, then doe theſe men their <hi>conſequences,</hi> let all men iudge.</p>
                     <p>A 6th abſurdety is, that theſe men can find <hi>diſtinctions</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the Morall Law from being aboliſhed, but none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Gods Sabbath commanded in that law. 2. Let Anabaptiſtes bring theſe textes Exod. 31.13. Rom. 14.5. Gal. 4.10. &amp; Col. 2.16. profanly, againſt Sabbaths in the Morall Law, and theſe my aduerſaries, will find anſwers and diſtinctions, to maintaine <hi>ſome day in generall,</hi> as morall in the 4th com: yea, to preſerue the <hi>Lords day,</hi> in the 4th com. which God neuer put there; and yet will find, nor admit of any diſtinctions, framed, to preſerue the Lords 7th day <hi>Sabbath,</hi> put there by God himſelfe: they haue an heart to defend their owne <hi>inventiones,</hi> which they haue thruſt into the 4th com. but none at all, to defend what they find in the ſame com. placed there by God himſelfe: they had rather ouerthrow it, then defend it.</p>

                     <p> A 7th abſurdety which theſe doe fale into, by bringing this text Col. 2.16.17. (or any other) is this, that they diſpute againſt <hi>Principles</hi> &amp; <hi>Maximes,</hi> now who ſo will diſpute againſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he deſerueth to be anſwered with clubes, rather then with reaſon: as all <hi>Artes</hi> haue their Principles, ſo hath <hi>Diuinity</hi> hir Principles alſo; now the 10 commandements, are as 10 <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ſtones,</hi> wherevpon a greate parte of the gloriouſe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſtian Religion doth ſtand; for all Religion ſtandeth vpon <hi>Law</hi> &amp; <hi>Goſpell; faieth</hi> &amp; <hi>workes;</hi> and theſe 10 commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, concerne that parte of Chriſtian Religion, which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in workes, to wit, in workes of <hi>Piety</hi> &amp; <hi>Charity.</hi> Now to diſpute againſt any ordinance commanded in theſe 10 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, is to make a bould and vnchriſtian attempte, to remoue and pull away, one of theſe <hi>foundation</hi> ſtones; or at leaſt if not a whole ſtone, yet halfe, or ſome peece and parte of a ſtone: and is it not a raſh, bould, and aduenturouſe parte of any man, to goe about to alter, remoue, take away, or diminiſh a foundation ſtone? yea, ſuch a ſtone as God himſelue the <hi>maſter</hi> builder hath laid, and not man? will they not indure it in <hi>Schoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> to heare a man diſpute againſt the Principles of <hi>Arte,</hi> and ſhall it be borne, that men ſhall diſpute againſt the Principles in <hi>Diuinity?</hi> No man may there, contradict the Axiomes of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> and ſhall men heere, be ſuffered to contradict the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of <hi>God?</hi> Ariſtotle, &amp; his axiomes, are more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Schooles, then God, and his Lawes, are amonge Diuines: where fore the Schooles ſhall riſe vp in iudgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Pulpites: for they honour Ariſtotles preceptes, more then theſe doe Gods praeceptes; after I had handled the 4th com.

                     <p>Furthermore, all other Scriptures, eſpecially if they be ſuch as neede expoſition, they are to be brought vnto the 10 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as to the common <hi>standard;</hi> &amp; <hi>Rule</hi> of triall, ſo as no expoſition may be admitted of, which any way croſſeth the 10
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:21140:196"/>commandements; this is a common receiued Rule in the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Scripture: but if theſe new Sabbatharians may haue their will, the 10 commandements ſhall be no longer a <hi>ſtanding Rule,</hi> for the expounding of other darkeſome Scriptures; this <hi>starre,</hi> which guideth vs in our nauigation to heauen ward, ſhall be plucked out of the firmament: for the Rule it ſelfe ſhall be queſtioned, whither all the partes of it be a Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Rule &amp; touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton of tryall, or not: for they will queſtion the 4th precept in this Rule: &amp; thus we ſhall haue no <hi>certainty,</hi> in the Scriptures, no <hi>Iudge</hi> in ſcriptures darkeſome; we muſt I thinke erre lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, to the <hi>Pope</hi> againe, to be a iudge in Scriptures doubtfull: nay theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe not onely doubt of ſome parte of this Rule, but they dare diſpute againſt ſome parte of it, in right downe termes, &amp; they will bring Scripture alſo againſt it, as Col. 2.16.17. but as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill brought Scripture againſt Chriſt, Mat. 4.6.</p>
                     <p>But ſince they will queſtion <hi>ſome parte</hi> of this rule, why may we not by as good leaue, queſtion the <hi>whole rule,</hi> euen all the 10. commandements? I can with <hi>Libertines</hi> &amp; <hi>Anabaptiſtes,</hi> bring Scripture too againſt all the 10. com. as well as they can againſt the 4th com. ſee Epheſ. 2.15 where it is ſaid, that Chriſt hath abrogated, <hi>the Law of commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts:</hi> whence a man might argue, if he would be ſo abſurd &amp; profane, againſt not onely ſomething in the 10 commandements, but alſo againſt euery thing in the 10 com. againe, Hebr. 7.12. <hi>Jf the prieſthod be changed, then of neceſſity muſt there be a chang of the Law:</hi> whence a man might alſo ſay ſomething againſt the whole Law, &amp; bring Scripture to backe him too: but foraſmuch as the Law, that is, the Law Morall, is an excellent <hi>Rule</hi> of our liues, &amp; a notable <hi>Rule,</hi> for the expounding of other hard &amp; darkſome places of Scripture, therefore we will not be ſo abſurd as to queſtion it, leaſt ſo we fale to queſtion euery thing, &amp; leaue no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in the Scriptures, nor any thing that migt be a Rule &amp; a light vnto other Scriptures, &amp; in concluſion, be driuen to the Pope againe, to determine of the ſenſe of Scripture for vs. So much for this their abſurdety, that they deny Maximes in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Principles in Diuinity, who deny the 7th day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, &amp; diſpute againſt it,</p>

                     <p> One abſurdety more is, that they who alleage this text, Col. 2.16. or any other, againſt the Sabbath day mentioned in the Morall Law, they herein ſhake hands, &amp; ioyne with lawleſſe <hi>Libertines</hi> &amp; <hi>Anabaptiſtes,</hi> who doe by theſe textes, oppoſe Gods Sabbaths, &amp; ſo liue profanly without any <hi>Sabbath,</hi> &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of this diuine <hi>ordinance:</hi> &amp; ſhall wee <hi>Proteſtantes,</hi> ſhake hands with <hi>Anabaptiſtes,</hi> in ouerturning Gods Sabbaths? <hi>God forbid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus hauing ſhowne, the diuerſe &amp; ſondry groſſe abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deties, which they rune into, who bring this text, Col. 2.16.17. (or any other) againſt the Sabbath day written in the Morall Law; now in the next place, let vs ſee their arguments out of this text, that ſo we may anſwer them; their arguments are two: the one of them is this, that by the word <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> or <hi>Sabbath daies,</hi> in this text, Col. 2.16. is meant all Sabbath daies, vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally &amp; generally; &amp; ſo if all Sabbath daies be aboliſhed, then the 7th day Sabbath alſo is aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Herevnto I anſwer, there is a Law Morall, &amp; a Law ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, now when we read, that Chriſt hath aboliſhed the <hi>Law of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements,</hi> Ephe. 2.15. &amp; againe, that <hi>Of neceſſitie there must be a chang of the Law,</hi> Heb. 7.12. if any man ſhould preſſe theſe textes to the aboliſhing of all lawes, we would anſwer them by diſtinguiſhing of Lawes, into <hi>Morall</hi> &amp; <hi>ceremoniall;</hi> ſaying, that theſe textes doe aboliſh onely the Law ceremoniall, but not the Law Morall: So may I anſwer them, in this point: for the Sabbath day is a <hi>branch</hi> of the Morall Law: for it is written in the Morall Law, &amp; commanded in the Morall Law; wherefore, I anſwer them by diſtinguiſhing thus, there be <hi>weekly</hi> Sabbath daies, commanded in the Morall Law; &amp; there are <hi>yeerly</hi> Sabbath daies, which were neuer written in the Morall Law; Leuit. 23.24.39. now this their text may be vnderſtod onely of theſe yeerly &amp; <hi>ceremoniall</hi> Sabbaths, &amp; not of the <hi>Morall</hi> &amp; weekly Sabbath: &amp; thus are theſe two ſcriptures, Exod. 20.8. &amp; Col. 2.16. reconciled.</p>
                     <p>And whereas they ſay, that all Sabbaths are meante in this text: I anſwer, that this <hi>all,</hi> may be meant of the <hi>ceremoniall</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, that all thoſe Sabbaths are aboliſhed: for, there is, an <hi>all</hi> of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:21140:197"/>them for they are many: ſo then, we may vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this text, to aboliſh all Sabbaths generally, that is, the <hi>generality</hi> of all yeerly Sabbaths; ſince there is a generallity of them: or, by <hi>all,</hi> we may vnderſtand all theſe Sabbaths excluded the Morall-Law, or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſtone, that is, all the Sabbaths written in the ceremoniall Lawes: &amp; ſo the 7th day Sabbath is not touched in this text: thus you ſee, there is no neceſſity at all, why they ſhould hale in the 7th day Sabbath into this text; for a fit diſtinction may ſalue all: wherefore if they will violently wring the 7th day Sabbath into this text, it is wilfully done of them, to ſatisfy ſome corrupt humour or other: you ſee this text may ſafely &amp; ſoundly be expounded of the annuall Sabbaths onely, without any the leaſt violence offered vnto this text.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore I anſwer, it is to be obſerued, that the Apoſtle ſpeaking heere of Sabbaths which are a <hi>Shaddow,</hi> he doth not ſay <hi>all</hi> Sabbaths. vſeing the generall particle <hi>all,</hi> but he ſpeaketh <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitly,</hi> ſaying, Sabbaths, or Sabbath daies, without this word <hi>all:</hi> &amp; therefore may be vnderſtod but of ſome Sabbath daies particularly: It is true indeed, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath daies, in the plurall number, but yet it doth not thereof follow, that therefore he ſpake of all Sabbath daies generally: thers a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt a <hi>plurality</hi> &amp; a <hi>generality;</hi> betwene Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bahts plurally, &amp; Sabbaths generally: for the Apoſtle may make Sabbaths plurally, that is, many Sabbaths, to be Shaddowes: &amp; yet not make Sabbaths generally, that is, all Sabbaths, to be Shaddowes: for example, a man may ſay, the <hi>Trees</hi> doe ſhaddow mee; and yet all Trees in the world, doe not ſhaddow mee. Againe <hi>Miniſters</hi> teach that the bread in the Sacrament is the very body of Chriſt: &amp; yet it followeth not that all Miniſters doe teach ſo; for proteſtant Diuines teach the contrary: ſo might Paul ſay, that <hi>Sabbaths</hi> were a ſhaddow, &amp; yet neither ſay, nor thinke, that all Sabbaths were a ſhaddow: and thus is their former argument anſwered.</p>
                     <p>By the weakneſſe of which argument, we may ſee the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their <hi>loue</hi> to God, &amp; his ordinance, &amp; to his Lawes: for ſtrong loue, would neuer permit them to raſe downe to the grownd, ſo <hi>honourable</hi> an ordinance as Gods Sabbath, &amp; to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:21140:198"/>Gods <hi>Law,</hi> the 4th com. with ſo weake an argument: and what would be the iſſue, if they might obtaine their deſires? why this, Gods Law ſhall be mangled &amp; defaced: it ſhall be denied its integrity &amp; perfection: it ſhall be made a <hi>Monſtre,</hi> partly morall partly ceremoniall: &amp; way made for Anabaptiſtry, &amp; the floud of prophaneſſe to flowe in vpon vs, by the want of Gods Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>An other argument they draw out of this text, againſt the Lords 7th day Sabbath (for they are wonderouſe eagre vpon it, &amp; deſire exceedingly to find, or make if they cannot find ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mething to defeate God &amp; his Church of the Sabbath day) &amp; for this purpoſe, they will faine a <hi>neceſſity</hi> vpon it, that by Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths in this text, we muſt of neceſſity vnderſtand the 7th day Sabbath for one: becauſe (ſay they) vnder the words <hi>Holy day,</hi> is meant all the ceremoniall yeerly Sabbaths, &amp; ſo then vnder the words <hi>Sabbath daies,</hi> muſt be meante the weekly Sabbaths.</p>
                     <p>Herevnto I anſwer, that it cannot be proued, that vnder theſe words <hi>Holy day,</hi> all yeerly Sabbaths are compriſed: for it may be that none of the yeerly Sabbaths are therin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſed: to make this appeare, let it be obſerued, that the word tranſlated <hi>Holy day,</hi> doeth ſignify alſo <hi>a feaſt,</hi> &amp; the words tranſlated <hi>in reſpect,</hi> may be tranſlated <hi>in parte;</hi> &amp; ſo for theſe words <hi>in reſpect of an holy day,</hi> you may haue in roome of them, theſe words, <hi>in parte of a feaſt</hi>

                        </gap>, &amp; then the text ſhould rune thus; <hi>Let no man condemne you in meate, &amp; drinke, or (in parte of a feast) or of the new moone, or of the Sabbath daies &amp;c.</hi> Now the queſtion is to know, what daies are ſignified by theſe words, in <hi>parte of a feaſt:</hi> &amp; for this purpoſe, looke into Leuit. 23.34.39. where you haue two <hi>feaſtes</hi> mentioned, &amp; either of them were to laſt 7 daies a peece: now the firſt day of the 7 ſhould be a Sabbath day, &amp; likewiſe the 8th day ſhould be a Sabbath day, as the text ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, v. 35.36.39. now foraſmuch as the firſt 7 daies were the whole feaſt, when the firſt day of thoſe 7 was taken out for a Sabbath day, then the 6 daies remaining, which went betwen the two Sabbaths, theſe were the <hi>parte of a feast:</hi> and theſe 6 daies, being the parte of that ceremoniall feaſt, theſe were thoſe which S. Paul might ſay were <hi>a Shaddow</hi> of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:21140:198"/>Chriſt; &amp; ſo aboliſhed: ſo now you ſee, what daies they were, which S.

                     <p>In concluſion, let me ſhew you what may be vnderſtod by theſe words <hi>holy day,</hi> or, <hi>in parte of a feaſt:</hi> and theſe words <hi>Sabbath dayes:</hi> by thoſe words holy day, or, in parte of a feaſt, may be meant thoſe 6 feſtiuall dayes, which went betwen the ij Sabbaths, but were no Sabbaths themſelues; &amp; then by thoſe other words in the text Col. 2.6. <hi>Sabbath dayes,</hi> may be meant theſe ij Sabbath dayes, which were the bounds of the 6 feſtiuall dayes, to wit, the firſt day, and the 8th day v. 35.36.39. toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all other annuall Sabbath dayes.</p>
                     <p>But if this pleaſeth not, then thus, by the words holy day, or rather feaſt, you may vnderſtand the Apoſtle to ſpeake of thoſe ij feaſtes of 7 dayes a peece, in v. 34.39. ioyning the firſt day Sabbath, with the following 6 dayes, and both theſe to make vp one feaſt conſiſting of 7 dayes: onely then theſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> muſt be tranſlated rather <hi>in reſpect,</hi> then <hi>in parte:</hi> for the words may be rendered both wayes: now if you put the firſt day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, vnto the 6 feſtiuall dayes; then by theſe words Sabbath dayes in Col. 2.16. may be vnderſtod the 8th day Sabbaths which followed the 7 feſtiuall dayes, and alſo all other yeerly Sabbaths with it, as thoſe mentioned Leuit. 23.7.8.21.24.27.32.</p>
                     <p>Or, if this yet pleaſeth not, (for they are hard to pleaſe, ſo eagre they are againſt the Lords Sabbaths) then thus, if by holy day, or feaſt, you will needs vnderſtand all dayes, both the

                     <p>By all which anſwers it may appeare, that it is no impoſſible thing to <hi>reconcile</hi> theſe two Scriptures Exod. 20.8.10. &amp; Col. 2.16.17. for, it appeareth, how many wayes the Apoſtles words may be taken, and ſtill the Sabbath day, written in the Morall Law, not touched at all, by this text Col. 2.16. and are they not wilfull and malitiouſe enemies, to the perfection of Gods Law, &amp; to his ordinance the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> who when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words may be taken any of theſe wayes, or ſome of theſe at leaſt, ſo as Gods morall Sabbath may be preſerued, but yet none of them will pleaſe them, but ſome other vnneceſſary ſenſe, muſt needs be violently thruſt vpon vs, and namly ſuch an one as may perpetually deſtroy the Lords Sabbath? why, is there no way to expound one text of Scripture, but ſo as it muſt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw an other? doe men delight themſelues, to make collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones and gather concluſiones, out of one portion of Scripture, which ſhall ouerturne for euer, that expreſly commanded in an other portion of Scripture? where is the feare of God all this while, and reuerence to his word and ordinances? are not theſe men guilty of the ſinne of <hi>adding to</hi> Gods word? Deut. 12.32. &amp; of that <hi>curſe</hi> threatened for the ſame cauſe? Reuel. 22.18? for like as they haue <hi>added</hi> diuerſe inventions to that text. Exod. 31.13. againſt Gods Sabbaths; ſo haue they <hi>added</hi> Gods 7th day Sabbath to this text Col. 2.17. for the ruine of it: and, they haue <hi>added</hi> this their invention to S. Pauls words, that he ſpake vniuerſally of <hi>all</hi> Sabbaths, when he ſpake but indefinitly of <hi>ſome</hi> Sabbaths.</p>
                     <p>Thre things more I haue to add by way of anſwer, vnto this text Col. 2.16. the formoſt is this, that there are reaſones in this text why it cannot be, that this word Sabbaths, ſhould be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtod of the Sabbath written in the morall law: the former
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:21140:199"/>reaſon is this, that all the other things mentioned in this text Col. 2.16. are ſuch things, as neuer came into the Morall Law, as 1. <hi>meate</hi> &amp; <hi>drink.</hi> 2. <hi>holy day,</hi> or feaſt, 3. <hi>new Moones:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this giueth vs an hint, to conclude, that the other thing mentioned in this text, namly the Sabbaths, ſhould be of like kind, to wit, ſuch Sabbaths as neuer came into the Morall Law neither: for, who could thinke, that all the other words and things in this text, ſhould be <hi>pure</hi> ceremonies, and ſuch as neuer came into the morall law; and this one word onely, to wit, <hi>(Sabbaths)</hi> ſhould conteine in it a Morall day, and ceremoniall dayes; or, dayes ſome whereof were neuer wrote by the finger of God, as the yeerly Sabbaths, and ſome ſuch as God wrote with his owne finger, in the morall law, as the 7th day Sabbath?</p>
                     <p>An other reaſon fetched from the text is this, that if in this word <hi>Sabbaths</hi> they will includ the 7th day Sabbath, commanded in the Morall Law, then doe they aboliſh by this text Col. 2.16. Not onely the 7th <hi>day,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Rest,</hi> but alſo the very <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement</hi> it ſelfe, the 4th com. &amp; that is aboliſhed vnder theſe words, where it is ſaid, that Chriſt hath <hi>Put out the handwriting of ordinances</hi> v. 14. In which words, the written 4th com. is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: and this I make appeare thus; the 16th verſe of this ſecond Chapter to the Coloſſians, is a concluſion, as you may perceiue by the note of inference vſed in it <hi>(Therefore)</hi> one of the premiſſes whereof you haue in v. 14. Now the Apoſtles argument is on this wiſe; <hi>If the handwriting of ordinances (which is the written Law, which commanded meate and drink, and holy daies, new Moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and Sabbath daies) be put out, and taken away; Then let no man condemne you in meate and drinke, holy daies, new Moones, and Sabbath daies: But the handwriting of ordinances, is put out, and taken away: Therefore, let no man condemne you in meate &amp; drink, holy daies, new Moones, and Sabbath daies.</hi> The Apoſtles Minor, you haue in v. 14. and his concluſion in v. 16. now foraſmuch as it is a rule with <hi>Logiceans,</hi> that there muſt not be more in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, then is in the premiſſes; hence it followeth, that if by the word Sabbaths in v. 16. they will vnderſtand the 7th day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, written in the 4th com. then by theſe words <hi>handwriting</hi> in v. 14. they muſt vnderſtand alſo the handwriting of the 4th com.
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:21140:200"/>or elſe there is more in the concluſion then in the premiſſes, for the premiſſe, v. 14. ſpeaketh but of the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dwriting of ceremonies writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Moſes onely, but in the concluſion v. 16. if they will includ not onely the ceremoniall law writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Moſes, but alſo a parte of thoſe things written by God in the Tables of ſtone, then in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I ſay, they haue both Moſes his handwriting, and alſo a parte of Gods handwriting, and ſo there is more in the concluſion then in the premiſſes: wherefore to auoid this abſurdety, they muſt vnderſtand the word handwriting in v. 14. to include not onely the handwriting of the ceremonies by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but alſo they muſt vnderſtand thereby, that parte of <hi>Gods</hi> handwriting whereby he commanded the 7th day Sabbath, which is the 4th com. and ſo you ſee they aboliſh the handwriting of the 4th com. it ſelfe, and ſo we ſhall haue no 4th com. at all: thus you may ſee wherevnto the oppoſition of Gods Sabbaths out of this text Col. 2.16. tendeth, namely to the ſubuerſion of the 4th com. let them talke what they will of obedience to Gods 4th com. and that they haue a reſpect with <hi>Dauid</hi> vnto all Gods commandements, yet all is but talke and words; iudge the Tree by the fruits; you ſee all their endeauors tend vnto the ſubuerſion of one of Gods Morall Lawes; and this is the firſt of my 3. Anſwers, which I tould you I had more to adde.</p>
                     <p>Now I come vnto an other of my anſwers, and it is this, that they that expound this text Col. 2.16. of the 7th day Sabbath, commanded in the Morall Law, they doe croſſe and contradict their owne <hi>Authours;</hi> &amp; ſuch writers of their owne, as are of high eſtimation with them: I will produce a fewe of them, in ſteade of many, that might be alleaged: I will begine with <hi>M. Perkins</hi> who frameth an obiection of ſome aduerſaries, which they make out of theſe ij textes Col. 2.16. and Gal. 4.10. ſaying, that if we obſerue any <hi>difference</hi> of dayes, now in the new Teſtament, then we are no better then <hi>Iewes:</hi> vnto which textes M. Perkines thus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>That both theſe places ſpeake of the feaſts of the Iewes, and of d fference of daies, that ſtands in force by the Iewiſh ceremoniall Law.</hi> Caſes of conſcience, Chapt. 16. Sect. 3. Pag. 108. Where you ſee M. Perkins, freeth this text Col. 2.16. from hauing any thing to doe againſt the Morall Law; or againſt the difference of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:21140:200"/>dayes in force by the Morall Law, by ſaying, that it ſpeaketh of a difference of dayes, which ſtode in force by the Iewiſh <hi>ceremoniall Law:</hi> now the 7th day Sabbath was neuer commanded in the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh ceremoniall law, but in the morall law.</p>
                     <p>Let vs heare alſo what <hi>M. Dod</hi> ſaith in this point; he anſwereth to an obiection framed out of this text Col. 2.16. againſt the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day on this wiſe: <hi>We muſt know (ſaith he) that here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle ſpeaketh of ſuch Sabbaths, as are in the ranke with the meates &amp; drinkes, whereof the ſpake before, of which ſorte were the first day of euery moneth, and the first and laſt daies of euery one of the 3 ſolemne feastes of the Iewes, of theſe he ſpeaketh in the plurall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and not of the Lords Sabbath day, in the ſingular number, which hath a ſingular excellencie, and, how euer times change, it neuer chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth: Dod</hi> on the 4th com. Pag. 132. In which words you ſee, M. Dod affirmeth, that this text Col. 2.16. ſpeaketh onely of the yeerly Sabbaths, which the Iewes kept in their 3 yeerly feaſtes; or 3 ſolemne feaſtes; &amp; doth plainly deny, that this text ſaith anything of the Lords 7th day Sabbath, which he caleth the Lords Sabbath day, in the ſingular number, by way of excellency.</p>
                     <p>Of this ſame iudgement, is <hi>M. Greeneham</hi> in his worke vpon the Sabbath: of the ſame iudgment alſo, is <hi>M. Elton</hi> vpon the Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, on this text Col. 2.16. of the ſame iudgement likewiſe, is Doctour <hi>Ames</hi> in his <hi>Theſis</hi> touching the Sabbath. To theſe fiue, I might add many more, that are of the ſame iudgement, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues cannot but know, ſeing they read them dally: one more I will add who is newly come forth, <hi>M. Richard Byfield</hi> againſt <hi>M. Brerewood</hi> on the Sabbath, who ſaith in expreſſe words, that this text Col 2.16. doth not aboliſh the Sabbath day in the 4th com. but thoſe other Sabbaths &amp;c. See him Pag 130. Thus you ſee, that they who would haue the Apoſtle to ſpeake of the morall Sabbath, mentioned in the morall law, as M. Chappel &amp; his 9 confederates would, they are contrary vnto Diuines of greate note of their owne ſide.</p>
                     <p>Obiection; ſay they, why doe you alleage <hi>M. Perkins</hi> and <hi>M. Dod,</hi> and others, why they doe not defend your opinion for the 7th day Sabbath, doe they? Herevnto I anſwer, it is not my purpoſe in this place to alleage them, as if they ſpake for the 7th
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:21140:201"/>day Sabbath: but onely for this purpoſe, to ſhew that they, euen thire owne Diuines will not indure it, that this text Col. 2.16. ſhould be preſſed any further, then againſt the Iewiſh ceremoniall law: and that it concerneth not the Lords Sabbath day, ſpoken of in the 4th com. ſingularly, but thoſe yeerly Sabbaths, ſpoken of plurally &amp;c. This is all I aime at by alleaging their Teſtimony, now the Teſtimony of a man againſt himſelfe, is euer accounted ſtrong and good: &amp; for me to produce one of my aduerſaries to iuſtify my cauſe, it is better and more forcible, then if I ſhould alleage an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>undreth Diuines, that are of the ſame iudgement with mee: and ſo much for this point.</p>
                     <p>My third anſwer to this text is this, ſuppoſe we that the 7th day Sabbath were a ſhaddow of Chriſt by this text Col. 2.17. yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ence vvill nothing follow neceſſarily, but that the Sabbath is aboliſhed as touching its typicalneſſe and <hi>ſhaddowiſh quality,</hi> that ſo it ſhall be no more vſed as a type or as a ſhaddow of Chriſt to come: but for all this, it may remaine ſtill, as a ſacred day and time for Gods worſhip, as a day to keepe memory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtill, as a fit time to refreſh man and beaſt in, by Reſt from the toilſome labours of the former Sixe dayes, and ſo as an helpe and furtherance vnto theſe morall dueties of Reſt from labour, and performance of Religiouſe exerciſes. For the clereing of this, I referre you to what hath bene ſaid in Section the 18. onely here let me giue a touch: <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and the <hi>Paſseouer,</hi> hauing either of them a double type or ſigne, when the one was fulfilled, yet theſe Sacraments were vſed with reſpect to the other vnfulfilled; and admit the Sabbath ſhould aboliſh as a ſhaddow of Chriſt, why may it not remaine as a ſigne of the Creation? Exod. 31.17. The difference of <hi>meates</hi> is aboliſhed as a ſhaddow of Chriſt, but remaine, as in a faſt; and admit the Sabbath be aboliſhed as a ſhaddow of Chriſt, why may it not remaine, as an helpe and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance vnto morall dueties? and if the <hi>Proſelite Gentiles,</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Paſſeouer with the Iewes, neglecting ſuch things therein, as were <hi>peculiar</hi> vnto the Iewes, and onely obſerued ſuch things therein, as were <hi>common</hi> to Iew and Gentile both (as hath bene ſhowne in Sect. 18) why may not we <hi>Gentiles,</hi> neglect the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath as a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>addow of Chriſt, wherein it was peculiar vnto the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:21140:201"/>and obſerue it ſtill in ſuch reſpects, as it is common to Iew and Gentile both? as it is a ſigne of the Creation? and as it is an helpe and furtherance vnto other morall dueties? ſo much for anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to this text Col. 2.16.17.</p>
                     <p>And thus like a friend to God, his law, and ordinance therein, I haue reconciled theſe two textes Exod. 20.8. &amp; Col. 2.16.17. the which other men doe make to fight together, like deadly enemies.</p>
                     <p>Before I conclude this Section, let me render a reaſon why I doe on all occationes diſtinguiſh, betwixt the 7th day Sabbath &amp; the anniuerſary Sabbathes: my reaſones are theſe 1. becauſe the 7th day Sabbath is more auncient then the yeerly Sabbaths: for theſe began but after the giuing of the Law; but that begane before the giuing of the Law. 2. Becauſe God <hi>Sanctified</hi> and hallowed the 7th day Sabbath in a ſpeciall manner Geneſ. 2.3. the which honour he did not to the yeerly Sabbaths: theſe were holy but by precept, but that alſo by Preſident: theſe were holy but by deſtination onely, but that was holy by conſecration alſo. 3. Becauſe they are diſtinct in themſelues, the one being once euery weeke, the other once euery yeere. 4. Becauſe God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the weekly 7th day Sabbath in his morall Law, and in the <hi>heart</hi> or firſt Table thereof, but the yeerly Sabbaths were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thence, and neuer came into the Tables of ſtone. 5. Becauſe the 7th day Sabbath was a ſigne of, and kept in memory of the Creation, which belongeth vnto all men alike, but ſo was it not with the yeerly Sabbaths: there is good reaſon therefore, why I ſhould diſtinguiſh the weekly Sabbath, from the yeerly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathes, according as I haue done in all my anſwers.</p>

                     <p>The perſones guilty of this ſinne, are both <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>people:</hi> for the people firſt; let them know, &amp; take ſpeciall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, that they lay vnder the guilte of the ſinne of <hi>Sabbath-breaking,</hi> vnto this day: &amp; without repentance, are liable to thoſe curſes, threatened in the booke of God, againſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoures of the Lawes of God: I ſpeake what I thinke is the trueth in my ſoule &amp; conſcience, &amp; I haue good cauſe thus to thinke; for, you haue ſeene that it cannot be certainly &amp; infallibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, to the vndoubted ſatisfaction of any mans conſcience, that euer God did aboliſh this Sabbath day; now if it cannot be moſt euidently &amp; apparantly proued, that it is aboliſhed, then though there could nothing be ſaid for it more, yet it is a ſinne to profane it: but I haue more to ſay for it, as you ſhall heare in the next Chapter, for time to come therefore let men beware, that they doe no more profane the Lords Sabbath day; it will be a dongerouſe matter to ſinne, &amp; goe on in ſinne, after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and information; this let them take notice of, as being
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:21140:202"/>forewarned, that they doe liue and lye in the weekly breach, of one of Gods Lawes: for euery 7th day or Saturday, they doe not onely neglect the worſhip of God, but alſo notoriouſly profane the Lords Sabbath day, by buying and ſelling, by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and goeing too market and fro market, by ploughing and carteing, by working in their Shoppes and howſen, euery man in his ſeuerall trade and occupation, and by doeing the moſt baſe drudgery and kitching workes, on this ſacred day: when God ſhould be moſt in our minds, then he is furtheſt from our thoughtes: let this be thought on, by all ſuch, as make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Gods commandements.</p>
                     <p>But herevnto the people will reply, ſaying, Alas, what would you haue vs to doe? we are no ſchollers, if it be an errour, it is in our Miniſters and teachers, &amp; not in vs; you ſhould doe well to apply this doctrine vnto our Miniſters &amp; not vnto vs; we cannot iudge in ſuch matters of difference &amp; diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty &amp;c. To whom I anſwer, Alas, indeed, I pitty you from my heart; this your errour is radically indede in your Miniſters, for the blind, doe leade the blind; neuertheleſſe you haue your ſhare therin: becauſe you iuſtify their doeings, &amp; approue of their ſayings &amp; doctrines in this point: Gods proceedings are on this wiſe, that if the Miniſter doth not admoniſh the people, of thoſe things which are ſinnes: the Miniſters indede ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to God for thy blood, but what will this auaile thee? for <hi>Thou ſhalt die for thine iniquity,</hi> as you may reade, Ezek. 33.8. &amp; for this cauſe, it is fite, I ſhould giue you notice therof, albeit I meane to lay the chiefeload vpon your Miniſters backes. laſtly whereas you pleade, that you are not able to iudge in ſuch points as theſe. Herevnto I anſwer, that men ſhould be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſay they cannot iudge, conſidering the time, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh; for men haue now bene trained vp a longe time in the doctrine of Chriſtian religion, &amp; therefore ſhould be able to iudge; the Apoſtle biddeth vs to <hi>Trye all things, &amp; keepe that which is good,</hi> 1. The 5.21. &amp; againe he ſaith, <hi>I ſpeake as vnto them which haue vnderſtanding: iudge yee what I ſay,</hi> 1. Cor. 10.15. Here you ſee the Apoſtle would haue common people to be iudges of that which hee taught; &amp; ſuch were thoſe noble
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:21140:203"/>
                        <hi>Bereans,</hi> Act. 17.11. wherefore you ought to iudge of this point, &amp; to this end to reade about it, to conferre of it, and to ſtuddy it: It is true, were it a point to be ſtuddied out, by your owne labour, from the roote of it, there were difficulty in it perhapes aboue your capacities; but when a point is alredy ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to your hand, &amp; a path way beaten oute for your foote ſteppes, now there is no invincible difficulty in the matter: it is true, that commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people cannot plead a cauſe before the Iudge, yet can they iudge, hauing heard both parties plead; people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preach, yet can they iudge of a ſermon preached; ſo in this point of the Sabbath, though people could not firſt finde it out, nor yet diſpute it when fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out, yet can they iudge of the cauſe when they ſee it laied plainly open before their eies, if they will open their eyes to ſee it, &amp; they may iudge of the cauſe, when they haue ſeene it pleaded on both ſides; to this end I haue pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this booke, wherein you haue the argumentes on both ſides, plainly laid downe, ſo as you may eaſily diſcerne the trueth, from errour.</p>
                     <p>Yet further, to take away all excuſes; the point in queſtion, touching this Sabbath day, commanded in the Morall Law, it is A <hi>Catechiſme</hi> point: for all the 10. commandements, they are Catechiſme pointes, like as are the Creede, &amp; the Lords prayer: now it hath pleaſed Almightie God, to lay downe theſe Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme pointes, of all other pointes in religion, moſt plainly, &amp; moſt familiarly, that he that runeth may reade them; the 10 co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are expreſſed to the capacety of the meaneſt in the Congregation, &amp; of all the 10 commandements, there is not any one laid downe in more familiar &amp; eaſy termes &amp; words to be vnderſtod, then is this 4th com. touching the Sabbath day; for God hath moſt liuely &amp; plainly, painted &amp; pointed it out from all other daies of the weeke, ſo that no man can doubt, which day of the weeke is that which God would haue for his Sabbath day; no nor yet what dueties God requireth to be done in that day: it is plaine, that that is the day, which is <hi>properly</hi> called Sabbath day, in Scripture account; &amp; which is the 7th day in Scriptures account, namly our Saturday: &amp; the dueties are Reſt, &amp; Holy actiones performed in that Reſt: theſe things
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:21140:203"/>are ſo plaine in the com. as they neede no expoſition; for they are put downe in ſo many words, in the com. now, what neede then is there of ſuch ſtore of lerning, to attaine to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe things, as if common people cold not vnderſtand them, nor any but Miniſters &amp; men of lerning could iudge of them? men may as well ſay they vnderſtand not Engliſh, as to ſay, they cannot vnderſtand &amp; iudge which is the 7th day of the weeke, &amp; what is meant, by Reſt from labour, &amp; performance of Holy actiones: for which is the 7th day, we cannot but knowe ſince the Sunday or Lords day, is the firſt day; &amp; what is meant by Holy actiones, or ſanctifying of the day, we know by the like actiones we performe on euery Lords day: a ſmale deale of lerning is enough for a man to iudge of theſe points; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is but an excuſe, for people to ſay they are no ſchollers, &amp; they cannot iudge of ſuch matters; what can you not iudge of your Catechiſme points, which you lerned in your Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode?</p>
                     <p>I confeſſe for all this, there is difficulty about this point, to ſuch as are not exerciſed in it (&amp; by the way, it is a ſhame for any man, not to be ſo well exerciſed in all Gods 10 comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, as not to be able to defend them, vnto the leaſt <hi>iote</hi> &amp; <hi>title</hi> againſt all oppoſers) but I deſire thee good Reader, but to obſerue where the difficulty lieth: for the cleering of this, note with me theſe ij. things, <hi>The 4th com.</hi> &amp;, <hi>the oppoſition made againſt this 4th com.</hi> For the former of theſe; the 4th com. together with the things therin commanded, are laid downe moſt familiarly, &amp; plainly, as hath bene ſhowne, ſo as thers no difficulty at all about that, no man but may eaſily vnderſtand, what it is which God requireth therin, &amp; which day of the weeke God inioyned for a Sabbath: wherefore the difficulty that is, it is in the <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> made by Miniſters, againſt ſomething commanded in the 4th com. now it is true indeede, that in this oppoſition, there ariſeth difficulty, becauſe they trouble the waters of mens vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, by bringing many &amp; intricate reaſones out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, againſt the Sabbath day written in the 4th com. which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate arguments, if theſe Miniſters would forbeare, then there were no difficulty at all, all were as plaine as a beaten path way;
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:21140:204"/>wherefore, ſince you ſee where the difficulty lieth, my counſaile to all ſuch people as plead ignorance, &amp; want of lerning in this controuerſy, ſhall be, that they would therefore rather follow <hi>God,</hi> then their <hi>Miniſters:</hi> for Gods way is a plaine, ſmooth, eaſy, &amp; beaten way, ſo as euery man lerned or vnlerned, may eaſily know, what it is which God requireth in this Catechiſme point of his 4th com. but their Miniſters way, in ſetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to abandon and roote out Gods Sabbath, it is ſuch a rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged way, &amp; ſuch a difficult way, full of ſo many ſecret &amp; hidden windings &amp; turnings, as people of common capacety cannot conceiue it, nor iudge of it, as themſelues ſay: wherefore, my counſaile vnto theſe is this, that they rather take parte with God, &amp; with his Sabbath, then with their Miniſters againſt God &amp; his Sabbath: becauſe Gods way is an eaſy &amp; knowne way, but mans way is an intricate &amp; difficult way.</p>
                     <p>And further, let them not dare to liue in the weekly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the 4th com. &amp; profanation of Gods Sabbath day, bearing themſelues onely vpon this poore grownd, that their Miniſters ſay they may ſo doe; &amp; that their Miniſters bring many arguments out of the Scripture, for the aboliſhing of Gods Sabbath day, ſince thoſe argumentes (as themſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) they vnderſtand not, nor are able to iudge of, for want of lerning, when they heare or reade them diſputed of: the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne,</hi> Rom. 14.23. If then they cannot comprehend &amp; conceiue of the oppoſit arguments, brought againſt the Sabbath, when they are diſputed too &amp; fro on boths ſids, how can they worke in their calings on this Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day? they cannot doe it of <hi>faith,</hi> they muſt doe it <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly,</hi> &amp; ſo ſinfully: wherefore the better &amp; eaſier known way, is the ſurer &amp; ſafer way, &amp; that is to follow the example of God, reſting vpon the 7th day, becauſe God reſted on the 7th day; &amp; thus much for people.</p>
                     <p>I come now vnto Miniſters; the firſt thing I lay to their charge, is the profanation of the ſacred Scriptures, and word of God, by wreſting of many and ſondry textes of Scripture, againſt the 4th com. and the Lords Sabbath day, therein mentioned: there are many and ſondry textes of Scripture, both out of the <hi>old
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:21140:204"/>Testament</hi> &amp; out of the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> which they abuſe againſt the Lords Sabbath day, the particulars whereof you haue heard in all this Chapter hitherto, and how vainly, impertinently, and friuolouſly they haue vſed them, doth euidently appeare by my ſeueral anſwers vnto them: now doe they not know, that one day they ſhall giue an accompt to God, for <hi>taking Gods Name in vaine?</hi> and for vnreuerent toſſing of Gods word, hither and thither like a Tenniſe bale? yea which is worſe, they turne the point of Gods ſword (his word I meane) againſt himſelfe; ſetting Scriptures together by the eares: for they ſet aboundance of Scriptures, both out of the old and new Teſtaments, againſt the Lords Sabbath day, commanded to be kept by the 4th com. like as a man ſhould ſet abundance of dogges vpon a Beare: for they ſet all theſe textes of Scripture, againſt this one text of the 4th com: now what may be the grownd of all this? I cannot deuiſe any beſids this, that their minds are foreſtaled with a preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt Gods Sabbaths, as that they are Iewiſh and the like, and therefore downe they muſt: and to this end, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt be ſet againſt them.</p>
                     <p>It hath euer bene the practiſe of all ſober and Godly Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to ſtudy and endeauor the reconciliation of Scriptures ſeemeing to make oppoſition and contradiction: but theſe men are of a contrary Spirit: for hauing to doe with Gods tenn commandements, and by name the 4th com. they cannot abide to heare me ſpeake of a reconciliation, and to make a reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt the 4th com. Exod. 20.8. and this text Coloſ. 2.16.17. but all their ſtudy and invention is, how they may make theſe two portiones of holy writ with others, to oppoſe one an other in the higheſt manner, &amp; one to ſhoulder out an other: my indeauors are by a reconciliation, to cauſe an Harmony and ſweete accord among the Scriptures, that ſo we may ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a moſt ancient and proffitable ordinance of Gods in the Church; but their indeauors are, to reiect all reconciliation, &amp; to cauſe a iarre and diſcord in the Scriptures, that ſo they may depriue the Church of God, of a moſt ancient and proffitable ordinance of Gods, commanded in his morall Law. This is a profane vſe and abuſe of Scripture, to cauſe it to be at oddes &amp;
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:21140:205"/>variance with it ſelfe, when as by a reconciliation and fit ſenſe, it may be made to agree &amp; accord in a ſwete Harmoney.</p>
                     <p>The 2 d thing I lay to the charge of Miniſters, is that they haue liued a long time in this ſinne of Sabbath breaking, and tranſgreſſion of Gods 4th com. in their ſeuerall families; the which without vnfeined Repentance, wil make them liable vnto all thoſe Curſes temporall and eternall, thereatened in Gods word, againſt ſuch as liue in the tranſgreſſion of Gods Lawes. And further, if ſtill they ſhall in time to come, liue in the wilfull violation of this ordinance of God, I giue them hereby to know, that they ſhall be guilty of a weekly ſinne, againſt Gods 4th com. drawing downe Gods curſes vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and their families, euery Saturday or Sabbath day, weeke by weeke, ſo long as they ſo liue.</p>
                     <p>This errour touching Gods Sabbath day, is not like vnto ſome other erroures, which are erroures in iudgement onely, but like vnto thoſe more dangerouſe and perniciouſe erroures, which are erroures both in iudgement and in practiſe alſo; for you ſee, that ſuch as are erroniouſly perſwaded, that this ſacred and Sanctified time, the 7th day Sabbath, is aboliſhed; forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they fale to an erroniouſe practiſe alſo, &amp; to trample vpon Gods Sabbaths, by profanation of them openly; and by calling them Iewiſh reprochfully.</p>
                     <p>But happily they will reply, ſaying, wee doe not throw downe Gods Sabbath, but God himſelfe doeth it; for it is God that hath aboliſhed the 7th day Sabbath; and therefore you doe ill to taxe vs for it: wherevnto I anſwer, that it is falſe which they ſay; to father this their owne deede vpon God, is an heinouſe euill; that God hath not done this thing is apparent, in aſmuch as none of all thoſe Scriptures of Gods, which they haue brought againſt this Sabbath, doe neceſſarily aboliſh it, as you haue ſeene by my anſwers vnto them one by one, ſo it is not God then but themſelues that haue done it; and ſo I taxe them iuſtly.</p>
                     <p>Yet further, Miniſters are guilty, not onely and alone of the ſinne of Sabbath breaking, in their owne families, but alſo which is more fearefull, they are guilty of the ſame ſinne committed by the people weekly: for whats the cauſe, why the people doe
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:21140:205"/>not Sanctify the Sabbath day properlie ſo called, is it not hence, becauſe Miniſters teach people that it is aboliſhed, &amp; Iewiſh, and therefore they ought not to keepe it holy? the people will lay the load of this ſinne, vpon their Miniſters an other day, when God ſhall rekone with them for it, crying out vpon their Teachers, who miſled them. S. Iames telleth vs, if ſome man hath converted an other from his errour, he ſhall ſaue a ſoule, and <hi>ſhall hide a multitude of ſinnes</hi> Iam. 5.19.20. If then this be an argument to perſwade all men, to labour to bring their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren out of errours, becauſe ſo they ſhall hide a multitude of ſinnes: what a terrour then ſhould it be vnto all Miniſters, to thinke that they haue ſeduced the people, and led them into erroures; for thus they haue opened a fountaine of ſinnes: for euery ſingle perſon in their congregation, Maſter &amp; ſeruant, Miſtris &amp; maide, Parent &amp; childe, euery one of theſe doe hereby fale into the ſinne of Sabbath breaking euery weeke, that is 50 times in one yeere, ſo as if a man hath liued but a matter of 40 or 50 yeeres, he is guilty of the breach of Gods 4th com. Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hundreth times; what a multitude of ſinnes are heere! &amp; all theſe are the Miniſter guilty of; theſe are the multitude of ſinnes committed by one ſingle perſon in his congregation, but if a Miniſter hath 400 or 500 perſones, or a thowſand perſones vnder his charge, what an infinit number of ſinnes is hee guilty of! let this be ceriouſly thought on.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, if it doth come into the heart of the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi> at any time, to thinke of a <hi>reformation</hi> (as God graunt it may) what is it that quencheth that motion of Gods Spirit in him? is it not this, that hee bethinketh him that his Miniſter, and ſo other Miniſters, are of a contrary iudgement, affirming with one conſent, that this Sabbath day, is aboliſhed, and ceremoniall, &amp; Iewiſh? ſo then, Miniſters are not onely guilty of the breach of Gods Sabbaths, among the people for time paſt, but alſo they hinder Reformation, in the perſones, in whoſe power it is to make Reformation: By the mercy of God, we liue in a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that is gouerned by <hi>Christian</hi> Magiſtrates; and vnder ſuch gouerners, as haue alredy made reformationes, in many things, wherein they haue bene informed by the Clergie; and I
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:21140:206"/>verily beleeue, they would as willingly take this point into their conſiderations, if moued therevnto by the Miniſtry, as they haue done other things: but behold, they who ſhould informe them, and cale vpon them, are dumbe and ſilent; nay enemies and aduerſaries to the cauſe! wherefore, that this Sabbath brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is defended by Authority, and not reformed, but the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it oppoſed by Authority, this is to be imputed vnto Miniſters; let this be ceriouſly thought on.</p>
                     <p>Herevnto happily ſome will reply, but theſe Miniſters who doe theſe things; are very zealouſe &amp; godly men &amp;c. To whom I anſwer, the more zealouſe the worſe, &amp; the more godly the worſe: it were enough for the moſt godleſſe &amp; profane men, to ſet themſelues againſt an ordinance of Gods, &amp; to oppoſe his Sabbaths; but for men fearing God, &amp; zealouſe for God, that theſe ſhould ſhew themſelues ſo regardleſſe of Gods ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; ſuch enemies to his Sabbaths, this is in them a double ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: for, who but they ſhould ſtand for God, and defend his Sabbaths?</p>
                     <p>In the third place, I lay many things to the charge of ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters as doe oppoſe Gods ancient Sabbath: as 1. that thereby they haue defaced Gods <hi>royall-Law,</hi> mangled it, &amp; robbed it of its integrity &amp; perfection: they haue diminiſhed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate number of Tenn Commandements: they haue made it a morall-ceremoniall Law, an hotch potch; a very Monſtre. 2. They bewray a greate want of <hi>loue</hi> vnto Gods Law, they doe not loue it for it ſelfe: for they indeauor might &amp; maine, to ouerthrow a parte of it: yea they are horribly <hi>partiall,</hi> in that they will defend all the other partes of Gods Law, againſt Anabaptiſts; but will not defend this parte alſo againſt them. 3. They open a flood gate to impiety and prophaneſſe among people; &amp; draw vs to Anabaptiſtry, by throwing downe Gods Sabbaths. 4. They are guilty of that <hi>ſinne</hi> in Deut. 12.32. and of that <hi>curſe</hi> in Reuel. 22.18.19. threatened to ſuch as doe either <hi>add</hi> to Gods word, or <hi>detract</hi> from it: for by that text, Ex. 31.13. they haue vnneceſſarily detracted from Gods Law, the 7th day Sabbath; &amp;, to that text, Coloſ. 2.16.17. they haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily added, the 7th day Sabbath, for the ruine of it: now
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:21140:206"/>in thus doeing, they behaue themſelues, like men, that are weary of Gods ſeruice, as if it were a burden vnto them to ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie Gods Sabbaths, &amp; as if it grieued them that Gods Sabbaths ſhould be morall: were it not thus with them, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer manage ſuch arguments and Scriptures againſt Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths as you ſee they haue done, oh preiudice! oh tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing!</p>
                     <p>But admit, that by reaſon of ſwaying with the times, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice againſt the Sabbath as Iewiſh, is faſtened in their breaſts, I ſee no cauſe why they ſhould reiect the Matchleſſe example &amp; preſident of God himſelfe, Exo. 20.10.11. is this <hi>Jewiſh</hi> too? for they cannot abide it, that the Church and people of God, ſhould be imitators &amp; followers of God like deere Children: that is, that they ſhould labour on thoſe daies wherin God wrought, &amp; reſt on that day wherin God reſted, &amp; ſanctify that time which God ſanctified, yea and alſo commanded: but like men, that loued not to be like God, they will haue the people reſt when God wrought, &amp; worke when God reſted, &amp; prophane the time which God Sanctified: they had rather goe any way, then treade in Gods ſteppes &amp; follow him.</p>
                     <p>The laſt thing which I lay to the charge of Miniſters, is that they haue taken away one whole com. from the 10. comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: in the former point, I haue taxed them for takeing away ſome parte of a com. but here I taxe them for taking away a whole com. by name the 4th com. and this I thus make good againſt them; 1. They haue taken away the time, to wit, the 7th <hi>day,</hi> in the com. the which being gone, there is no <hi>day</hi> time lefte in the com. ſo that an howre vpon any day in the weeke, ſpent at a Lecture, in prayer, ſinging a Pſalme, &amp; hearing Gods word, is as much as the 4th com. can now require, by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitiones: now therfore the 4th com. needeth no longer goe thus, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day:</hi> for it may goe thus, <hi>Remember the Sabbath howre:</hi> 2. They haue aboliſhed the dueties in the day, to wit, <hi>rest,</hi> &amp; <hi>Holy actiones:</hi> for the word Sabbath ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying reſt, this reſt they haue aboliſhed, by making the word Sabbath &amp; reſt, in the 4th com. a <hi>ſigne,</hi> Exod. 31.13. and a <hi>Shaddow,</hi> Coloſ. 2.17. &amp; ſo aboliſhed; now if the Sabbath and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:21140:207"/>reſt be aboliſhed, then may men labour in their callings euery man in his owne houſe ſeuerally; &amp; this taketh away holy Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in the congregation, &amp; all publike dueties of a Sabbath: &amp; thus haue they aboliſhed by their corrupt gloſſes &amp; expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both the time, &amp; the dueties to be performed in the time, now theſe being gone, I pray ſhew me what is lefte behind in the 4th com. for they haue aboliſhed euery thing that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. 3. By making theſe words <hi>Sabbath day</hi> a ſigne, Exo. 31.13. and a Shaddow, Col. 2.17. and ſo aboliſhed, thus they haue taken away the Subſtance of the 4th com. &amp; lefte vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſhaddow; ſo as now we may reade the 4th com. thus: <hi>Remember the 0000000000, to Sanctify it:</hi> &amp; thus much for the body of the 4th com.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, they haue taken away the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and Motiue, which God tooke from his owne example, &amp; added it to his 4th com. Exod. 20, 11. this whole verſe, v. 11. conteining ij. moſt liuely reaſones &amp; effectuall, they haue robbed Gods Church of the vſe of them; for they neither vſe them themſelues, no neither can man elſe vſe them, vnto the day we now keepe: for God did moue vnto the obſeruation of the Saturday &amp; 7th day. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe him ſelfe at the Creation reſted on it. 2. Becauſe he had bleſſed that day, &amp; hallowed it, &amp; ſo made it an Holy day. now theſe two reaſones neither are, nor can be applied to our Lords day: for God at the creation did not reſt on our Lords day; no neither did he then bleſſe &amp; ſanctify the Lords day; for the Lords day was not then knowne. Thus you ſee, how they baue made cleere worke; for they haue taken away both the body of the 4th com. &amp; the reaſone annexed to it by God; thus they haue taken away the whole 4th com. head &amp; taile, roote &amp; branch: it ſtands for vs now onely to looke vpon.</p>
                     <p>Loe, now we may ſay with the Prophet Dauid, <hi>It is time for thee Lord to worke, for they haue deſtroied thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.126. Thus ſince I haue faithfully &amp; plainly diſcouered this Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſe errour, I haue done what in me lyeth towards a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; onely this remaineth, that with the reſidue of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, I make this prayer vnto God, <hi>That it may pleaſe him to bring into the way of trueth, all ſuch as haue erred, &amp; are deceiued.</hi>

               <head>CHAPT. V. This Chapter conteineth ſondry &amp; ſubſtanciall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of the word of God, proueing that the Lords Sabbath day, written in the Morall Law, is ſtill in force; &amp; ſo ought to be vnto the worlds end; like as are the other morales.</head>
               <p>I Haue now finiſhed the fowre firſt partes of my booke: the firſt whereof was in defence of the Morall Law. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was an expoſition of the 4th com. with a diſcouery of the corrupt expoſitiones thereof. The third was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer vnto thoſe Scriptures &amp; reaſones, wich are vſually brought to proue the Lords day, the Sabbath day. The fowrth was an anſwer, vnto thoſe abuſed Scriptures, which are brought againſt the Lords Sabbath day. And now by order I am come vnto the fith parte of my booke, and herein I am to proue vnto you, the perpetuity of the Lords Sabbath, and that it is ſtill in force, and ſo ought for euer to be.</p>
               <p>Touching the Sabbath I note two things. 1. I ſee many lerned and greate Diuines of late, prime men, and of the formoſt ranke in the Vniuerſities, both on this ſide and beyond the Seas, diſclaiming and wrighting againſt the Lords day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; but I ſee none of them ſhew vs where we ſhall haue an other Sabbath, in the abſence of this: as the former bewrayed their learning and iudgement, ſo this latter bewrayed their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe: what, ſhall the Church of God be left without a Sabbath now? ſhall we turne from <hi>Superſtition</hi> to <hi>Anabaptiſtry?</hi> I ioyne with them in throwing downe the Lords day for a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but I dare not put an end to the worke, when it is but halfe done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As thoſe Iewes of old cried, the Temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, ſo I obſerue the Patrons of the Lords day, to cry out of the prophanation of the Lords Sabbaths, the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lords Sabbaths, as if they were the onely friends to
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:21140:208"/>Gods Sabbaths; whereas in deed &amp; in trueth, they are the chiefe enemies to them, and are foulely miſtaken in their iudgement: for they are the <hi>Lords dayes</hi> which they meane, &amp; not the <hi>Lords Sabbath dayes:</hi> if therefore any man may in a right accompt be ſaid to be a true friend to Gods <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> it is not they, it is hee that writeth for them, and defendeth them againſt the world, and corruptiones of the time: hee may indede ſay with <hi>Eliah,</hi> I haue bene very <hi>Ielouſe</hi> for the Lord of hoſtes: for they haue forſaken thy Couenant, broken downe thy <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and <hi>I onely am left.</hi>

                     <head>SECT. I.</head>
                     <p>IN defending the Lords Sabbath, I purpoſe to obſerue this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: firſt I will proue the point by arguments leſſe forcible, and then by arguments more forcible: firſt by arguments ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is a thing meete, convenient, and very befiting vs to keepe the Lords Sabbath, &amp; then by arguments ſhewing that it is a thing very neceſſary, in regard of Gods appointment &amp; ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>By the way, whereas there are many light and triuiall obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, vſually brought againſt the Lords Sabbath, and ſome place would be reſerued to anſwer them, I think it vnfit, to place them, after the point is proued by neceſſary arguments: for when Gods will is once knowne, there is no place left for carnall and triuiall obiections againſt it: and therefore I hold it better to place theſe obiections, next after the point is proued by probable arguments, and arguments of conveniency: and ſo theſe triuiall obiections, ſhall rather come in by way of oppoſition vnto arguments of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, then vnto arguments deriued from Gods ordination. Wherefore, I purpoſe to ſpend the firſt Section about arguments
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:21140:208"/>of <hi>conveniency,</hi> and the ſecond Section in anſwer vnto ſondry <hi>obiections,</hi> and then the third Section in arguments prouing the point neceſſarily from Gods ordination.</p>
                     <p>To begine with the firſt of theſe, namly conveniency, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments leſſe forcible; in handling of this point, firſt I will proue by ſondry arguments, that it is meete we ſhould keepe a Sabbath day, one or other indefinitly; and then I will proue that it is moſt meete, &amp; fiteſt, to keepe the Saturday or 7th day Sabbath, before any other. (One reaſon mouing me to handle theſe two points is, to preuent Prophane and carnall men thus to thinke, why you haue throwne downe the Lords day Sabbath, &amp; now therfore, what need we any more Sabbaths &amp;c? I procede therfore to giue ſuch reaſones as may take place in a carnall mind.) For the former of theſe, I proue, that it is meete we ſhould keepe a Sabbath day, becauſe it is a worke of <hi>mercy:</hi> that this may the better appeare; we will conſider of it in reſpect of <hi>man</hi> &amp; <hi>beast:</hi> touching man, we will conſider of him <hi>generally,</hi> and then <hi>particularly:</hi> and firſt for man in generall; it is a greate comforte and worke of mercy vnto all men to keepe a Sabbath day; for therein their bodies are exceedingly refreſhed and comforted: for looke as the Bedd at night, is a greate refreſhment, vnto man that hath bene occupied all the day before in his painfull calling; ſo is the Sabbath day, a ſweete refreſhment vnto men, after that they haue bene exerciſed Sixe dayes one after an other in continuall laboures: the trueth of this point euery man findeth by good experience. We haue a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb, that men muſt worke to day, as they may worke too mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: that is, that men doe not ſo ouerworke themſelues in one day, as they be vnfit for worke the next day: this prouerb may well be applied to our preſent occation, that men muſt worke this weeke ſo, as they may worke the next weeke alſo: that is, they muſt not ſo worke and tyre out their bodies, with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall laboures in one weeke, as that they ſhall be vnfit to labour an other weeke: now common reaſon teacheth, that mans body cannot endure continuall and perpetuall laboures, day by day, without ceaſeing all his life longe; wherefore of neceſſity there muſt be a time for men to Sabbathize, &amp; reſt in from laboures; &amp; therefore it is meete that ſome one day in a weeke be ſet a parte
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:21140:209"/>for reſt, that ſo a man may ſo worke one weeke as he may worke an other alſo; it is a point of wiſedome alſo, for men ſo to follow their workes, as they may goe on, &amp; continue with them; &amp; not like vnskilfull Riders, who ride galloping vpon the ſpurre in the forenoone, ſo as their tyred horſe cannot goe in the after noone; wherefore, if men doe but regard their owne bodies, it is meete they ſhould ſet a parte a day to Sabbathize in, and reſt from their laboures.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe we, that ſome mans body, being of any oaky ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, &amp; yron conſtitution, could hould out in laboures, day by day euerlaſtingly; yet how vnbeſeeming a thing is it, for man, whom God hath made <hi>Lord</hi> of all, to become a ſlaue &amp; a drudge in this world, working and tuging day by day without ceaſeing like horſe in a Carte? neither can men pleade neceſſity; for, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath taught, that we can compaſſe all our workes within the 6 dayes: nor yet can the poore plead neceſſity, becauſe of their pouerty; for, as God gaue the Iſraelites, twiſe ſo much Manna on the 6th day, as vpon any other day, that ſo they might reſt vpon the Sabbath day; So hath God bleſſed the eſtabliſhed order in our kingdome, of working but 6 dayes in 7, that the poore can now earne as much in 6 dayes, as they ſhould doe in 7 dayes, if it were cuſtomary for vs to worke euery day; for did the poore worke 7 dayes, the rich would giue them the leſſe for euery dayes worke, ſo as they ſhould but barely get a liuing then, and ſo much they get now; for becauſe they worke but a fewe dayes, therefore they haue the more for euery dayes worke, that ſo they might liue of their worke: thus much for men in generall.</p>
                     <p>I come now to men in particular, &amp; by name vnto Seruants: It is needfull that we keepe a Sabbath, becauſe it is a worke of mercy vnto Seruantes: now God was wont to take care for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, leſt they ſhould be vnmercifully oppreſſed with labour, and therefore it is added to the 4th com. <hi>That thy m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:21140:209"/>then vnto his man ſeruant, and maide ſeruant? were it not that we haue good Lawes in this caſe, prouiding for <hi>Seruants,</hi> by forbiding maſters to doe their workes on the Lords day, ſome vnmercifull, hardharted, and couetuouſe maſters, would worke their Seruants day by day, vntill they were weary of their liues: the neceſſity of a Sabbath in this caſe, appeareth by the Lawes now in force, whereby for the benefit eaſe and refreſhment of poore Seruants, it is enacted (no doubt) that many holy daies ſhall be obſerued yeerly &amp; weekly.</p>
                     <p>In the 3d place I come to Beaſtes, it is needfull that we keepe a Sabbath, that ſo we may ſhew mercy vnto our beaſtes: for God was wont to cale for mercy vnto the labouring beaſt: <hi>In the 7th day thou ſhall reſt, that thine oxe and thine Aſse may reſt.</hi> Exod. 23.12. and it is a property (ſaith Salomon) of a good man, to ſhew mercy to the life of his beaſt Pro. 12.10. and ſhould a man labour his beaſt on euery day weeke by weeke, he might ſoone haue his skine. Thus farre we haue conſidered of the needfulneſſe ca Sabbath day, in ciuill reſpects.</p>
                     <p>Now I come to ſhew the needfullneſſe of a Sabbath in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe reſpectes: that God may be ſolemnely and publiky wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped; &amp; that the Church and people of God, may be further edified in their moſt holy faith; for theſe two cauſes, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that there ſhould be a Sabbath day: I ſhall not neede to ſpend time to amplify theſe two things; for they are ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and needfull, that all men will grante me, that it is meete to haue a day ſet a parte for the publike worſhip of God, &amp; the edification of the Church of God: to omit what elſe might be ſaid, the neceſſity of a Sabbath day appeareth in this, that our Church doth now celebrate many Holy daies for the ſame ends, &amp; not onely the Saintes daies yeerly, but alſo the Lords daies weekly.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is meete to haue a Sabbath day, becauſe it is a thing of good reporte, approued &amp; allowed of by all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches, now the Apoſtle calleth vpon vs to follow thoſe things which are of <hi>good reporte,</hi> Phil. 4.8. &amp; thoſe things therfore which all Chriſtian people approue and allow of, are meete to be had in vſe. <hi>Papistes</hi> they allow of reſting from laboures, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:21140:210"/>worſhip of God conſtantly vpon one day of euery Seauen: <hi>Lutherans</hi> doe the like: and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> how euer they keepe no day by Diuine Inſtitution, yet they keepe, and hould it fit to keepe one day in Seauen, wherin they reſt from their labours, and performe publike worſhip vnto God. laſtly, all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doe allow and approue of one day in Seaven, as fit to reſt in from labours, and to worſhip God publikly: ſo here is a clowde of witeneſſes, houlding it meete to keepe a Sabbath day, and a thing of good reporte. If we ſhould aſcend vnto the <hi>primitiue Churches</hi> who liued next after the Apoſtles, we ſhall find that they held it meete to keepe one day in 7 and ſometimes more, for the Seruice of God, and to reſt from laboures: thus we haue a generall and ioynt conſent of all Churches, both now liuing, and from the Apoſtles times, that it is a thing meete to reſt, and ſerue God publikly one day in a weeke: and ſo we haue proued this point, namely, that it is meete &amp; convenient to kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe a Sabbath day indefinitly, one in 7 daies.</p>
                     <p>Now I come to proue, that of all the daies of the weeke, the 7th day, or Saturday is the moſt fit day: my firſt reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God Almightie Reſted rather vpon the Saturday then vpon any other day, Geneſ, 2.3. and therefore it is meete we ſhould imitate ſuch a preſident: were a man to make his choiſe on which day of the weeke to Reſt from laboures, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh himſelfe, I thinke he could not poſſiblie find a more fit day to Reſt in, then on that day, wherin God Almighty Reſted.</p>
                     <p>My ſecond reaſon is taken from this, that a man may <hi>doubt</hi> whither the old Sabbath day be aboliſhed or not, and if it be diſputable and doubtfull, then when the matter is in our choiſe, which day of the weeke to take, it is the ſureſt and ſafeſt to make choiſe of that day, whereof there is ſome doubt whither it be aboliſhed or not: we haue ſhowne, it is certaine that the 7th day is not aboliſhed; but ſuppoſe there were ſome doubt of it, as it cannot be but doubted of, by the ſtifieſt Anti Sabbatha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians: ſince that ſome place is leſt for doubting, be it that we doubt neuer ſo litle of it, yet it is better and ſafer to keepe it, then to keepe any other day of the weeke: to neglect the 7th
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:21140:210"/>day, being once Commanded of God, and it cannot be <hi>cleerly</hi> proued, that euer God <hi>countermanded</hi> it, here vpon ſome ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at leaſt muſt remaine in mens conſciences touching it; and therefore it is fiteſt to keepe the 7th day; ſo ſhall we make ſuer worke, that God ſhal haue nothing againſt vs out of his 4th co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. but doeing otherwiſe, we ſhall laye in perpetuall doubts &amp; fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that we liue in the tranſgreſſion of the 4th com.</p>
                     <p>So much be ſpoken for this point, the which I haue inſiſted vpon, not ſo much hereby to proue that the 7th day muſt be the Sabbath, for that I ſhall doe after the next ſection, by ſolid arguments, but chiefly to this end, to ſtay &amp; ſatisfie the minds of carnall men, with carnall reaſones, &amp; with Teſtemonies, and the like: for ſome men there are (I feare me) that could wiſh in their hearts, that there were no Sabbaths at all; of ſuch an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and baſe Spirit they are; all their minde is for worke, worke, vnceſſantly; it is meete therfore that it ſhould be declared vnto ſuch men, that it is not onely neceſſary to haue a Sabbath in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſe &amp; diuine reſpects, but alſo in carnall reſpectes, as for neceſſity of nature, and the like: and that otherwiſe all <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> would condemne vs; for not onely the <hi>primitiue</hi> Churches, but alſo all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> euery where, &amp; of euery Sect, doe ſet a parte one day in 7 for Gods worſhip: yea our owne Church would riſe vp in iudgment and condemne ſuch conceipts by hit contrary and daily practiſe.</p>

                        <p>One obiection they haue againſt the Lords Sabbath day, and it is this: what ſhall we keepe the Sabbath day, the 7th day, the Saturday Sabbath, why that is the <hi>Iewes</hi> Sabbath day?</p>
                        <p>Herevnto I anſwer, my deſire it not to ſtriue aboute names; were the Lords Sabbath day, called the <hi>Jewes</hi> Sabbath day, in none other, nor worſe ſenſe, then that it might likewiſe be
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:21140:211"/>called the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Sabbath day, I ſhould ſay nothing to the contrary; but finding it ſo called reprochfully, I deſire to reſcue it from vnder the feete of contempt.</p>
                        <p>I deſire therefore of ſuch men as ſo cale it reprochfully, to giue me a reaſon, why the Sabbath day commanded in the 4th com. ſhould rather be called the Iewes Sabbath day, then the Lord our God, whom we are commanded to Haue, in the firſt com. ſhould be called, the Iewes Lord God: for my parte, I can ſee no reaſon, but that the one may be ſo called reprochfully, as well as the other: nor any thing can I ſee to the contrary, but that we may as well cale the Sabbath day, which the Iewes San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, our Sabbath day alſo; as to cale the Lord God, whom the Iewes worſhipped, our Lord God.</p>
                        <p>But to take of vniuſt ſcandall, let not men nickname the Lords Sabbaths, but rather in an holy reuerence of God, let vs cale them as God himſelfe calleth them, that is, the Lord Gods Sabbaths: for thus the Lord himſelfe named them in his 4th com. when he ſaid. <hi>The 7th day, is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God:</hi> So then it is Gods Sabbath, not the Iewes Sabbath: it is the Sabbath of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and not the Sabbath of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> The Lord telleth vs by his Prophet Iſaiah, that we ſhould <hi>cale the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable.</hi> Iſa. 58.13.

                        <p>Yet further, the Sabbath was ordeined from the Creation Geneſ. 2.3. Now at the Creation, there was no difference of <hi>Iew</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentile,</hi> how then can the Sabbath be called the Iewes Sabbath? it may be therfore the Gentiles Sabbath, as well as the Iewes Sabbath: ſo much for this name or nickname.</p>

                        <p>An other obiection is this, oh but this were to bringe into the Church ſuch ſtrictneſſe as is <hi>intollerable:</hi> for if we admit of the Iewes Sabbath day, then muſt we not ſo much as kindle a fyer on the Sabbath day, nor doe any worke at all, how needfull ſoeuer it be.</p>

                        <p>An other obiection is this; what ſhall we doe, ſay ſome; Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are at variance, one ſaith the old Sabbath day is in force ſtill, &amp; others ſay that it is aboliſhed longe agone, by the coming of Chriſt; wherefore I ſhall giue no regard to this new Doctrine, vntill Miniſters can agree among themſelues, and till all men be at one accord in this matter: for they bring reaſones on both ſids, ſo as a man cannot tell which to beleeue.</p>
                        <p>Herevnto I anſwer, if men ſhall tarry till all men are agreed, ſo they ſhall profeſſe no trueth, nor any Religion; for all men are not at accord in any Religion, nor almoſt in any point of

                        <p>It is a Catechiſme point, to know Gods Sabbath day; and a point of greate conſequence, neerly concerning vs all; as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not onely becauſe it is an ordinance eſtabliſhed by the Morall Law; but alſo in this, that it is put downe in euery Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, as behofefull for euery one to be acquainted with all; now if ſuch a point come into controuercy, all men ſhould giue attendance vnto it, and ſtudy it, vntill the trueth be boulted out.</p>
                        <p>Neither let this be any ſtumbling blocke, becauſe this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is <hi>new;</hi> for, albeit it be new vnto our times, yet it is as old Doctrine, as is any in the 10 commandements: but what &amp; if it be new to thee? the Doctrine of the Goſpell was as new to the <hi>Bereanes,</hi> as the Doctrine of the Sabbath can be to thee; and yet they did not argue thus careleſly as you doe, ſaying, Paul hath broched a new point of one Chriſt &amp;c.

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:21140:213"/>the holy Ghoſt vnto all Poſterity: oh that men in theſe times, would turne <hi>Bereanes,</hi> and ſerch the Scriptures, to ſee if I ſpeak according to them or not; if I bring not an expreſſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement for that I cale for, let me be reiected: or try, whither they or I come with <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord</hi> in our mouthes; I bring you the plaine Scripture, to wit, the 4th com. and they bring you nothing but their reaſones and conſequences, which they ſay come out of Scripture, if one may beleeue them; but ſince their reaſons and conſequences doe thwart and croſſe a plaine commandement of Almightie Gods, therefore their reaſons &amp; conſequences againſt the Sabbath day, are to be reiected; for mans reaſon muſt not contradict Gods expreſſe word; vnleſſe we will ſet reaſon aboue Scripture: would people but marke theſe things, they ſhould not be long in doubt, vnleſſe they will.

                        <p>An other obiection is this, to ſay that the old Sabbath day is ſtill in force, is to ſay by conſequence, that our Church is in an errour; now can it be thought that the <hi>Church</hi> of God can lay in ſuch an errour as this, touching Gods Sabbath day? it is impoſſible.</p>
                        <p>Herevnto I anſwer, that it is meete we ſhould hold as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable an opinion of our Church as may be; and yet for all that we are not bound to beleeue, that it is a thing <hi>impoſſible</hi> for our Church to be in an errour, &amp; in as great an errour too as is this: there are ij. ſortes of erroures, there is an errour of <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe</hi> &amp; <hi>wilfulneſſe,</hi> againſt the light of conſcience; &amp; there is an errour of <hi>frailty &amp; ignorance;</hi> this latter kindof errour, may &amp; doth befale euery godly perſon, and may befale any Church of God on earth: for it is a property of the Church Triumphant in heauen, to be freed from all erroures.</p>
                        <p>Now that A Church of God on earth may faile, I proue by theiſe inſtances; The <hi>Patriarkes,</hi> they liued in polygamie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:21140:213"/>many wines, which for any man now to doe, were a ſinne againſt the 7th com.

Againe, did not the Church of <hi>Galatia</hi> fale into a greate errour, when the Apoſtle taxed them, as if they had bene <hi>remoued away vnto an other goſpell,</hi> Gal. 1.6.

Laſtly, and to add no more, how came it about (if a Church of God cannot erre about ſuch a point as the Sabbath day) that thoſe pureſt and primitiue Churches, which liued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the Apoſtles, did neglect to keepe this Lords day Sabbath, for diuerſe hundreth of yeeres; for ſo ſaith M.

                        <p>An other obiection againſt the Lords Sabbath, is this, that if we admit of the old Sabbath againe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhall bring <hi>Iudaiſme</hi> into the Church; and be guilty of a kind of <hi>Hereſy</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Wherevnto I anſwer, it followeth not: for the Primitiue Churches, were of a contrary iudgement, as it appeareth by <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Homilie <hi>de ſemente: wee aſsemble togheter (ſaith Athanaſius) in the Sabbath day, not as if we weere ſicke of Iudaiſme, but therefore we meete on the Sabbath, that we may worſhip Ieſus, the Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> Where you ſee, that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in the name of the Church, teſtifieth, that they were not infected with <hi>Iudaiſme,</hi> becauſe they kept the Sabbath day: the ſame may alſo be true of our Church, we may keepe the Sabbath day, and yet be free from Iudaiſme.</p>
                        <pb n="392" facs="tcp:21140:214"/>
                        <p> It is to be noted, that not euery thing which the Iewes prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, was to be accounted for Iudaiſme; for then the whole Morall Law ſhould be Iudaiſme: wherefore thoſe things onely are to be accounted for Iudaiſme, which neuer came into the Morall Law, or 10 com. and which were written by Moſes, of which number were their Sacrifices, Prieſtes, meate, new moones, feaſtes, &amp; annuall Sabbaths: but as for this old Sabbath wherin God himſelfe reſted, this was put into the Morall Law, and written by the finger of God; and to ſanctify this Sabbath, is no more Iudaiſme, then to honour our Superioures, is Iuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme; for why ſhould the things commanded in the 4th com. be more Iudaiſme, then the things commanded in the 5th com.?</p>
                        <p>Since they cannot proue this Sabbath to be a ceremony and aboliſhed, as you haue ſeene in the 4th part of this booke, it is therefore abſurd for them to call the Sanctification of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Iudaiſme.</p>
                        <p>Yet further, ſince they onely who keepe the Sabbath, doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue &amp; yeeld obedience to the Law in the integrity &amp; perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof, and doe giue God his wholl worſhip in all the parts thereof; they may as well ſay it is Iudaiſme for a man to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and pefect in the Law, and to giue God his wholl worſhip intirly; and brand him with Iudaiſme, vnleſſe he will mancle Gods Law, and be partiall in the Law, and in Gods worſhip, ſeruing God by halues.</p>
                        <p>And further, if it be Iewiſh and Iudaiſme to keepe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, to wit, the old Sabbath day. then 1. the 4th com. is <hi>Iewiſh:</hi> for it commands nothing but Sanctification of the old Sabbath day. 2. If it be Iudaiſme to keepe the old Sabbath, then is it Iudaiſme for Miniſters to call in the Pulpit for the Sanctification of the Lords Sabbaths, &amp; to vſe the name <hi>Sabbath day:</hi> for this is as well a Iewiſh name, as the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it is a Iewiſh practiſe: &amp; if we may vſe the name with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tincture of Iudaiſme, why not the thing named alſo? 3. What is the keeping of the Lords day better then Iewiſh? for doe not we reſemble the Jewes, by ſetting a part on wholl day in euery weeke for Gods worſhip, as they did? 4. Since the Sabbath day was commanded to be kept, in imitation of God,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:21140:214"/>as that we ſhould Reſt on the 7th day, becauſe God reſted on the ſame day, Exod. 20.10.11. men may therefore ſay it is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh, &amp; Iudaiſme, to become followers of God. 5. Since the Sabbath was kept in memory of the Creation, men may ſay it is Iewiſh, to celebrate weekly, a thankfull remembrance of the Creation.</p>
                        <p>For matter of Haereſy, both <hi>Athanaſius, Ignatius,</hi> and the primitiue <hi>Churches</hi> obſeruation of the Sabbath day, will cleere vs of Haereſy: to obſerue the Sabbath with its typicall &amp; ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowiſh quality, as a ſigne &amp; Shaddow of Chriſt (if euer it were ſo) this were Haereſy: but renowncing all ſhadowiſh reſpectes, &amp; to keepe it onely as a ſigne of the Creation, &amp; remembrance thereof; as a ſacred time for the worſhip of God; as a fit time to exerciſe mercy in to man &amp; beaſt, by a reſt from laboures, &amp; ſo as an helpe vnto theſe morall dueties of reſt, &amp; God worſhip, this can be no Haereſy: for we refraine thoſe meates in a faſt, which were ſhadowiſh; &amp; obſerue <hi>Whie-Sunday</hi> or <hi>Pentecoſt day,</hi> which was a ſhaddow of Chriſt, &amp; yet are farre enough from Haereſy: ſee Act. 21.20.26. Rom. 14.5. hereto I might add the Teſtimonies of all thoſe Diuines, iuſtifying this point for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, which you ſhall find hereafter in my third argument, for the defence of the ancient Sabbath.</p>
                        <p>I grant, the Laodicean <hi>Counſaile</hi> anathematized it; but the more ancient &amp; more pure <hi>Churches</hi> Sanctified it.</p>
                        <p>If it be Haereſy to keepe Gods Sabbaths: then 1. it is Haereſy for Miniſters in Pulpits to vſe the name Sabbath day. 2. It is Haereſy to celebrate a day weekly in a thankfull remembrance of the Creation. 3. It is hereſy for the Church and people of God, to become followers of God, by working whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wrought &amp; reſting when he reſted. 4. It is hereſy to walke in obedience to the 4th co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 5. It is hereſy to be intire &amp; perfect in Gods Law, &amp; to haue an vnpartiall reſpect vnto all Gods commandements: yea it is hereſy to giue God his wholl worſhip intirly. In a word, ſince the Sanctification of the Sabbath is a part of Gods worſhip, if for all that men will call it hereſy, I ſay with S. Paul Act. 24.14. <hi>After the way which they call Haereſy, ſo worſhip I the God of my fathers.</hi>

                        <p>Herevnto I anſwer, tis true indeed, that this obiection poſſeſſeth the minds of many that are very <hi>Religiouſe</hi> and well affected, but herein they bewray their ignorance, &amp; their halting and haluing with God: the things which God hath ioyned together let no man put aſſunder; did not God ioyne the day, and the dueties of the day, both together in one commandement? and hath not the day the ſame <hi>Authority</hi> to countenance it, that the dueties of the day hath? in a Bond there is ij things inioyned, the day of payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; theſemme of money; now is it not a moſt abſurd thing for any man to reaſon thus; it is the mony that my Creditour chiefly regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and ſo be I paye him his money, it matters not ſo much for the day; whither I pay it vpon the right day ſpecified in the Bond, or on ſome other day after it? men dare make more bould with God &amp; bis Bonds, then with a Creditour; though man will not put it vp, yet they make God to put vp any thing; men think it enough to obey halfe of Gods 4th com. and to leaue the other halfe vndone: but God muſt haue an account giuen him one day, for his whole 4th com. as well as for the one halfe of it: yea why ſhould we not yeeld God obedience, to the one halfe of his 4th com. as well as to the other halfe? this is not to haue reſpect vnto

                     <p>Hauing taken out of the way, their vſuall obiectiones, which they raiſe againſt the Lords Sabbaths, I come now to proue the point &amp; that by good &amp; ſtrong euidence out of Scripture: Onely one caution I deſire firſt to propound vnto my Reader; which is, to deſire him in the feare of God, to empty his minde of all kinde of preiudice, &amp; to lay aſide all foreſtalledneſſe of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, either of my perſon, or of the cauſe in queſtion, that ſo he may bring a mind like vnto true ballances, equally poiſed.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that being it is an ordinance of God which I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute for, it ſhould incline euery godly heart, rather to imbrace it then to reiect it; and rather to take parte with God, &amp; with his ordinance, then againſt God &amp; his ordinance, but if this cannot be obtained, yet let thus much be graunted, that no man reade theſe arguments, as wiſhing that Gods Sabbaths may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be aboliſhed then continued &amp; eſtabliſhed: for in vaine ſhall his reading &amp; my writing proue, if he come with a mind fully bent againſt the point in queſtion beforehand, rather wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing that it may proue a falſehood then a trueth: for the better auoiding of this, let it be obſerued, that it is a property of an hardened heart, of a benumed conſcience, &amp; of a man well nigh forſaken of God to reſiſt knowledge, &amp; to dislike of the meanes thereof, when it is tendered vnto him: for this purpoſe ſee Act. 28.27. <hi>For the heart of this people it waxed fat, &amp; their eares dull of hearing, &amp; with their eyes they haue winked, leaſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes, &amp; heare with their eares, &amp; vnderstand with their h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>My firſt argument, to proue the 7th day Sabbath, is ſtill in force, is becauſe the Lords day Sabbath is not in force, and thus it may be framed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Euery man fearing God, muſt maintaine &amp; defend, either the 7th day Sabbath to be ſtill in force, or the Lords day Sabbath.</hi>

Becauſe there is none other day in queſtion betwixt vs, but theſe two daies, to wit, the old Sabbath, and the new Sabbath, there is no third day, and therefore one of theſe two daies, muſt be our Sabbath day of neceſſity: and one of theſe two daies, euery man muſt defend &amp; ſtand for.</p>

                           <pb n="402" facs="tcp:21140:219"/> 2. I proue the firſt propoſition by this, that vnleſſe we ſtand for one of theſe two Sabbaths, there ſhall be no Sabbath day at all in the Church; this were an heinouſe impiety; yea worſe then a ſauage brutiſhneſſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I proue this Major by this, that vnleſſe we all ſtand for one of theſe two daies, we are contrary vnto all men; euen to the Church wherin we liue, for our Church acknowledgeth a Sabbath, as due vnto God, &amp; ſhee accordingly giueth him one of theſe two daies weekly.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I proue this Major by this, that vnleſſe we maintaine one of theſe two daies, we profanly &amp; impiouſly liue in the breach of one of Gods tenn Commandements, by name, the 4th com. for if we deny both theſe daies, then doe we neither keepe a Sabbath day, nor <hi>the</hi> Sabbath day: all diuines confeſſe, that the 4th com. inioyneth <hi>a</hi> Sabbath day, one or other, though not <hi>the</hi> Sabbath day, to wit, the 7th day: ſo then, euery man fearing God, muſt defend &amp; ſtand for a Sabbath day, one or other, the old day, or the new day; or elſe he liueth in the ſinfull breach of the 4th com. weekely: And thus much for the profe of the Major, or firſt propoſition.</p>
                        <p>I come now to the Minor, or ſecond propoſition, to wit, That no man fearing God, may maintaine &amp; defend the Lords day for a Sabbath: and this I proue thus, 1. Becauſe a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not defend this day in faith, &amp; <hi>Whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne Rom.</hi> 14.23. now it behoueth euery man that feareth God, to looke to the gouernment of his tounge, that he ſpeaketh not in defence of any thing, vnleſſe he can doe it in faith: now that a man cannot ſpeake for this Lords day or new Sabbath in faith, I thus proue it; becauſe he hath no <hi>word</hi> of God for the grownd of his faith; &amp; that faith which hath no word of God for its fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, it is not faith but fanſy, ſuperſtition, and preſumption: That a man can haue no word of God, to grownd &amp; found his faith vpon, for the Lords day, I thus proue it, 1. becauſe Chriſt hath left no commandement in the new Teſtament, for vs to ſanctify the Lords day; it is no where ſaid in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Remember the Lords day to ſanctify it.</hi> 2. As there is no expreſſe commandement for the Lords day, ſo is there no
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:21140:219"/>collection or conſequence, that can be made out of any text of Scripture, whereby it can be neceſſarily &amp; infalliblie proued, that euer Chriſt ordeined this day, or left any commandement touching it, with his Diſciples or Apoſtles: &amp; that this is ſo, I proue 1. by the third parte of this my booke, where by way of anſwer, I haue ſhowne, that none of all their Scriptures, nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which they doe alleage for the Lords day, will or can proue it any more then a <hi>Lecture</hi> day, at the moſt; they cannot proue it a Sabbath day: &amp; this firſt argument is of greate conſequence, and much to be thought on.</p>
                        <p>I proue it alſo by the Teſtimony of Diuines of note, &amp; firſt of <hi>M. Perkines,</hi> who thus doubtfully argueth for the Lords day, in his ſecond reaſon for it, in his Caſes of Conſcience, Chap. 16. Sect. 2. pag. 106. <hi>The Sabbath day in the new Teſtament (ſaieth he) in all likelihood is tied to that which we cale the Lords day, &amp; that as J take it (ſaith he) by Christ himſelfe.</hi> And then by &amp; by he addeth theſe words, <hi>for in theſe points still we muſt goe by like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoods:</hi> by all which doubting ſpeeches you may ſee, that M. Perkins was of opinion, that it could not be proued out of the Scriptures, neceſſarily &amp; infallibly, that the Lords day is a Sabbath: as for doubtfull probable proofes, and likelihoods, what haue we to doe with them in points of this conſequence? for if the matter be doubtfull, then it cannot be done in faieth, Rom. 14.23. <hi>He that doubteth eateth not of faith,</hi> ſaith Paul. <hi>and whatſoeuer is not of faieth, is a ſinne.</hi> 2. Doctour <hi>Prideaux</hi> in his worke vpon the Sabbath day, thus writeth, <hi>where finde you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>amongst the Euangeliſts, or Apoſtles, any diſtinct inſtitution of the Lords day, yea, where is the text of Scripture</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whereby you can neceſſarily proue it?</hi> pag. 143.

                        <p> My ſecond profe of the minor, is from this, that our Sauiour Chriſt made the Lords day a trauailing day; for he trauailed too &amp; fro, in the Country, from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> a matter of 15 miles, vpon the Lords day, as you may reade Luk. 24.13.15.29.36. ſo alſo, the Diſciples of Chriſt made this day a trauailing day, as you reade in the fore alleaged text Luk. 24.13.15.29.36. yea, which is more, the Diſciples and Apoſtles of Chriſt, they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant that the Lords day was a Sabbath day: &amp; this I thus proue; the Lords day (as the Patrons thereof hold) is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in memory of the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt; now the Apoſtles themſelues did not beleeue that Chriſt was riſen from the dead, vntill the day was paſt, or vntill night, as you may ſee Mark. 16.10.11.13.14. Luk. 24.36.38.41.45.46. Ioh. 20.19.26.27.

                        <p>My third profe of the Minor, is from the 4th com. for there the Lord commandeth vs to labour Sixe dayes, ſaying, <hi>Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour &amp;c.</hi> Now this commandement was neuer repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; &amp; the Lords day, is one of theſe 6 dayes, and by name, it is the firſt of the 6, or the firſt day of the weeke; wherefore by Gods ordinance and commandement, this Lords day is a labouring day, &amp; a working day: &amp; therefore no man fearing God, may ſpeake to defend the Lords day, to be a Sabbath day, &amp; a reſting day, vnleſſe he will contradict Almightie God.</p>

                        <p>My 2d argument, to proue the 7th day Sabbath ſtill in force, is becauſe it was neuer yet aboliſhed: &amp; thus it may be framed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Euery man fearing God, muſt maintaine &amp; defend, either that

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But no man fearing God, may maintaine &amp; defend, that the 7th day Sabbath was aboliſhed.</hi>

                        <p>For the Major, or firſt of theſe propoſitiones, it is of vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable trueth: for either the 7th day Sabbath muſt be aboliſhed, or elſe it muſt be in force: one of theſe two muſt be a trueth; for there is no third way: ſo then this firſt propoſition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied.</p>
                        <p>I come to proue the minor, or ſecond propoſition, to wit, that no man fearing God, may maintaine &amp; defend that the 7th day Sabbath is aboliſhed: and my reaſon hereof is, becauſe it cannot be defended in <hi>faieth;</hi> no man can ſay in faieth, that the 7th day Sabbath is aboliſhed: &amp; this I proue, becauſe there is no word of God for the grownd of their faieth: for, there is not in all the new Teſtament, any commandement or Prohibition, as a Countermand to the 4th com. where it is expreſly written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſanctify the 7th day Sabbath:</hi> no, neither is there any text of Scripture, out of which it can be neceſſarily proued, that the 7th day Sabbath is aboliſhed; that this is true, it appeareth by the 4th parte of my booke, where by way of anſwer vnto all their abuſed textes, which they brought againſt the 7th day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, I haue ſhowne the vanity and abſurdety of their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: wherefore, ſince they cannot ſoundly &amp; infallibly proue, that the 7th day Sabbath is aboliſhed, therefore may not any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeake againſt the 7th day Sabbath: for if he doth, he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt it, not of faieth, &amp; <hi>whatſoeuer is not of faieth, it is ſinne</hi> Rom. 14.23. &amp; no man fearing God, will wilfully vſe his tounge or penne ſinnefully.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I proue the point by many abſurdeties, that ſuch doe rune into, who defend the 7th day Sabbath to be aboliſhed: as 1. hereby they deface Gods royall Law, mancle it, rob it of its Integrity &amp; perfection, diminiſh the compleate number of Tenn commandementes, make it a morall ceremoniall Law, &amp; a very monſtre among Gods lawes: this no man fearing God ſhould doe. 2. Since the Lords day is no Sabbath day, they that
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:21140:221"/>defend the 7th day Sabbath to be aboliſhed, they caſt downe all Sabbaths of Gods, and ſo draw vs to Anabaptiſtry, and open a flood gate to all impiety &amp; prophaneſſe among people: which no man fearing God ſhould doe. 3. Since no day can be Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day by the 4th com. but the old Sabbath day, as hath bene proued, therefore they that hold and make it aboliſhed, they make that holy prayer of our Church a meere babling with God: for the 4th com. being rehearſed, in vaine we ſay, <hi>Lord haue mercy vpon vs, and incline our heartes to keepe this Law:</hi> now no man fearing God, ſhould make fruſtrate ſuch a deuout, and ancient prayer of our Church, by his abſurd tenentes.

                        <p>

                        <p>And ſo I come vnto the Minor, &amp; here I ſhall proue, that ſuch as are no friends to the 7th day Sabbath, doe confeſſe that it is ſtill in force: and this I ſhall proue either by their expreſſe words, or elſe by neceſſary conſequence from their words: for albeit they neuer intended to ſpeake a word in defence of Gods Sabbath, yet ſo cleere and apparent hath bene the trueth, as they could not but ſpeake for it, albeit they fauoured it not. my firſt Teſtimony ſhall be that of Doctour <hi>Prideaux</hi> in his booke of
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:21140:221"/>the Sabbath Pag. 140. <hi>It is manifeſt (ſaith he) that our Sauiour did often contend with the Phariſies, about the ſuperstitiouſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Sabbath day, but where is there any thing about the abrogation of it? at vbi de abrogatione ipſius ſuſpicio? and where is there any mention of ſetting the Lords day in the roome of it? did not the Apostles keepe the Sabbath of the Iewes, with the Iewes, without any ſcruple, after the aſcention of Chriſt? &amp; did not the followinge Churches doe the like for many yeeres?</hi> If then, there be no <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> of the abrogation of the Sabbath day, in the new Teſtament, as Doctour <hi>Prideaux</hi> ſaith, then it neceſſarily followeth, that the Sabbath day is ſtill in force.</p>
                        <p>My ſecond Teſtimony ſhall be that of <hi>M.

Perkins doth plainly affirme, that this 7th day Sabbath is morall: and conteſteth againſt thoſe who hold it to be a ceremony, ſaying, they ſpeake falſly &amp;c. Now if it be morall &amp; no ceremony, then it muſt needs be ſtill in force.</p>
                        <p>My third Teſtimony ſhall be that of M. <hi>Dod,</hi> on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, who in his expoſition of the 4th com. pag. 122. ſaith, that the <hi>Sabbath is morall &amp; perpetuall:</hi> &amp; againe, <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to proue the Sabbath day to be perpetuall,</hi> Now that all this muſt be true of the old Sabbath day, &amp; not of the Lords day, is plaine, 1. Becauſe he nameth the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Seaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th day.</hi> 2. Becauſe he fetcheth reaſons to proue the morality, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods <hi>reſt</hi> at the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; becauſe it was a day <hi>bleſſed:</hi> now theſe things cannot agre to our Lords day. 3. In pag. 129. he thus conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: <hi>So that theſe reaſones doe moſt euidently confirme, to the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:21140:222"/>artes of all Gods childere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the keeping of the Sabbath day is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, and bindeth vs, and all men to the end of the world, as much as it did the Iewes afore Chriſt.</hi> 4. In pag. 124. he brings an other reaſon for the morality of the Sabbath, from the time of its firſt inſtitution, in <hi>Adams</hi> innocency, ſaying, <hi>Now then ſince it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in Paradiſe, &amp;c. it may not be reputed among ceremonies.</hi> Now this cannot be vnderſtod of the Lords day, other reaſons of his I ſpare: well, if the old Sabbath day be morall, as it muſt be by theſe his words and reaſones, then it is ſtill in force.</p>
                        <p>My 4th Teſtimony ſhall be that of Doctour <hi>Bownd</hi> in his booke of the Sabbath, pag. 40. <hi>The 4th com.</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no more be partly morall &amp; partly ceremoniall; then the ſame liuing creature, can be partly a man, &amp; partly a beast: yea, as well may one ſuppoſe (ſaith he) the ſecond Commandement to be partly morall &amp; partly ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall alſo.</hi> If then, the 4th com. be not partly ceremoniall, as touching the 7th day, then is the 7th day ſtill in force.</p>

                        <p> And ſo I come to the Minor, or ſecond propoſition, to wit, that No day of the weeke, can be a Sabbath day by the 4th com. but the 7th day onely. And this I proue from the 4th com. it ſelfe, where the Lord hath commanded vs to worke <hi>all the daies</hi> of the weeke, ſaue the 7th day: for there the Lord hath expreſly commanded vs, to worke and labour vpon the Sixe dayes, ſaying, <hi>Sixe daies ſhalt thou labour, &amp; doe all thy worke.</hi> Exod. 20.9. wherefore, we cannot both worke vpon theſe Sixe dayes, and alſo keepe one of them weekly, for a Sabbath day, therin reſting from worke: this were impoſſible, to worke vpon euery one of the 6 dayes, &amp; yet to reſt from worke vpon ſome one of them: Nay further, this were to make God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelfe, and that in one &amp; the ſame commandement; if he ſhould by this 4th com. inioyne men to worke vpon the 6 dayes, and yet for all that, ſhould inioyne men in the ſame commandement, to reſt from worke in one of thoſe 6 dayes: wherefore no day of theſe 6 dayes, can be a Sabbath day by Gods 4th com. this is moſt plaine, vnleſſe you would ſuppoſe fooliſhly, that God ſhould ſay, &amp; vnſay it againe, with the ſame breath: wherefore, ſince none of the 6 dayes of the weeke can be Sabbath day, therefore the 7th day onely muſt be the Sabbath day.</p>
                        <p>I cannot deuiſe what euaſiones, they ſhould finde againſt this trueth, vnleſſe theſe two; the one is this, tis true (may they ſay) Sixe dayes we muſt labour; by the 4th com. and doe we not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Sixe dayes, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſt the 7th day, conſtantly euery weeke? Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>day, Tewſday, Wedneſday, Thurſday, Friday, &amp; Saturday, in theſe 6 dayes we labour, &amp; on Sunday, the 7th day, we reſt from labour; new the 4th com. doth not tell vs which 6 dayes we are to labour in. Herevnto I reply, that this kind of anſwer is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon indeede, but it is idle &amp; fooliſh; for this were to count the dayes of the weeke in a moſt abſurd faſhion, differing both from the computation of our owne <hi>Church;</hi> &amp; alſo of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> as for our Church wherin we liue, doe they not all account <hi>Sunday</hi> or Lords day, the firſt day of the 7, or of the weeke? how then cometh it about, that theſe men will begine at <hi>Monday,</hi> for the firſt day of the weeke? as if Monday were the firſt day of
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:21140:223"/>the weeke, or of the 7 dayes. 2. This account is differing from the Scripture account: for the Scriptures haue euer rekoned our <hi>Sunday</hi> or Lords day, for the firſt day of the weeke, as we reade Mat. 28.1. Mark. 16.1.2. Luk. 24.1. Io. 20.1. The day after the Iewes Sabbath, was called the firſt day of the weeke, Luk. 23.56. Ioh. 19.31. Mark. 16.1. Mat. 28.1. compared with Luk. 24.1. Ioh. 20.1. Mark. 16.2. and Mat. 28.1. Now it is knowne to all the world, that Saturday is the Iewes Sabbath day; ſo then <hi>Sunday</hi> muſt be the firſt day of the weeke; becauſe Saturday the Iewes Sabbath day, is the 7th day, &amp; the laſt day of the weeke. It is alſo plaine by this, that we all hold, that Chriſt roſe vpon our Sunday, or Lords day, now the Scripture calleth that day whereon Chriſt roſe, <hi>the firſt day of the weeke;</hi> wherefore if theſe men will begine at <hi>Monday</hi> for the firſt day, they haue reiected Gods account, and therefore we may reiect this their account: foraſmuch as we are about Gods matters, we muſt follow Gods account: wherefore, ſince this account to begine the weeke at Monday is a nouelty, &amp; of mans deuiſe, it is to be reiected as vnwarrantable; there is none accounte war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, but a <hi>Diuine</hi> accompt, and that account is to rekone Sunday for the firſt day: neither is there any accompt warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the Church, but the <hi>Churches</hi> accompt, and the Church wherein we liue, accounteth the Lords day, or Sunday, for the firſt day of the weeke, and not Monday.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, if the Iewes might haue taken this libertie, to begine the weeke where &amp; at what day they would, as theſe men doe, then might they haue diſappointed God of his 7th day Saturday Sabbath, before Chriſts coming in the fleſh; &amp; if they would haue begune at Monday for the firſt day, as theſe doe, they might haue laboured vpon that day, whereon God reſted; &amp; profaned the Saturday Sabbath, and giuen God the Sunday Sabbath as we doe now; for if they had rekoned <hi>Monday</hi> for the firſt day, then Sunday after would haue bene the 7th day.</p>
                        <p>Finally, whereas they ſay that the 4th com. hath not declared vnto vs which 6 dayes we ſhould labour in, this is falſe: for God hath plainly diſcouered it in his 4th com. which are the 6 dayes; &amp; that theſe wayes, 1. they are thoſe 6 dayes we ſhould
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:21140:224"/>labour in, which God himſelfe laboured or wrought in, to wit, the firſt 6 dayes from the Creation; as you may ſee by the reaſon added to the com. <hi>for in 6 daies the Lord made the heauen and the earth &amp;c.</hi> Exod. 20.11. ſo God ſetting himſelfe as a patterne vnto vs, we are to follow his enſample, which is, to worke on thoſe 6 dayes, wherein God himſelfe wrought: which point, we haue further proued in the expoſition of this parte of the 4th com, formerly. 2. God hath reuealed it, in his 4th com. by commanding vs to ſanctify the <hi>Sabbath day;</hi> now the Sabbath day, was on the 7th day, on our Saturday; wherefore ſeing we know which day is the reſting day, thereby we know which are the labouring dayes; for all the 6 daies which goe before the Sabbath day, reſting day, or Saturday, thoſe are the 6 working dayes. So you ſee, it is but an idle cauill, to raiſe doubtes about the 6 daies which God appointed out for labour. 3. If we will not imitate <hi>God,</hi> labouring thoſe very 6 daies wherein God wrought, then we fale into theſe abſurdeties. 1. that as they begine &amp; make Monday the firſt, ſo may I begine at Tewſday for the firſt, or Thurſday, or Friday, or skip ouer 100 or 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>0 daies before I ſet a firſt day, and ſo God ſhall haue a Sabbath but once in an 100 or 1000 dayes. 2. To ſay the 4th com. hath not declared vnto vs which 6 daies we ſhould labour in, ſince it is manifeſt by the conſtant practiſe of the Church of the Iewes, one may as well ſay, that the 4th com. hath not declared by the word (day) whither we muſt keepe a <hi>naturall</hi> day, or an <hi>artificiall</hi> day, or the day of <hi>grace,</hi> which is a day conciſting of many yeeres: as we muſt haue recourſe to the practiſe of the Iewes for the one, ſo for the other. And thus much for their firſt euaſion.</p>
                        <p>An other euaſion they haue, &amp; it is this, that theſe words in the 4th com. Sixe daies thou ſhalt labour, They are not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, but a <hi>permiſſion:</hi> as if the Lord had ſaid, Sixe daies mayeſt thou labour, if thou wilt: Herevnto I reply 1. that theſe words are an expreſſe commandement, as well as any other: for they are deliuered in commanding termes, as well as any other, this point I haue formerly proued, in the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe words in the 4th com. therefore here I omit to repeate it. 2.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:21140:224"/>Admit that theſe words be but a permiſſion, yet ſo they will make enough for my purpoſe, &amp; that thus; for if God did in his 4th com. permit vs, and giue vs leaue to worke, in thoſe 6 daies wherein himſelfe wrought at the Creation; then cannot any wiſe man thinke, that God would in the very ſame commandement, forbid vs to labour in ſome one of thoſe 6 daies: vnleſe you will thinke, that God permitted vs to worke vpon a day, and reuoked his permiſſion againe, and all vnder one breath. Wherefore, ſeing that God gaue vs leaue, to worke by his 4th com. vpon all thoſe 6 daies, which goe before the Iewes Sabbath day, &amp; our Saturday, the 7th day; therefore if we will haue any Sabbath day, from the 4th com. we muſt betake vs to the 7th day, our Saturday, the Iewes Sabbath day: &amp; that becauſe God hath permitted vs to worke vpon any day, ſaue the Saturday. Thus much for my 4th argument.</p>

                        <p>My 5th argument, to proue that the 7th day Sabbath is ſtill in force, is becauſe to ſanctify the 7th day Sabbath, is a parte of the 4th com. or a parte of the Decalogue and 10 Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thus it may be framed.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I haue purpoſly framed this argument, for the ſake of thoſe who doe ſo dote vpon this fiction, that the <hi>Time</hi> in the 4th com. it is but a circumſtance, and an accident, and I cannot tell what other triuall thing they make of it; but (ſay they) if it could be once proued vnto vs, that this <hi>Time</hi> of the 7th day, were a parte of the Law, or of the 4th com. then would we ſoone imbrace it: well, they ſhall ſee it therefore proued to be a parte of the Law of God.</p>
                        <p>For the Major, or firſt propoſition, I thus proue it, Euery parte of the Law is ſtill in force, becauſe the Law is ſtill in force, for if the Law be in force, then of neceſſity the partes of the Law muſt be in force this followeth neceſſarily, by the rule of Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianes, <hi>Poſito aut remoto toto, neceſſe est poni, vel remoueri partes.</hi> But the Law is in force, as you may reade, Rom. 3.31.

                        <p>In a word, whoſoeuer denieth this Maior, he is an enemy to the <hi>Integritie</hi> &amp; <hi>perfection</hi> of Gods Law, he muſt be partiall in the Law: yea, he muſt hold it <hi>Jewiſh</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudaiſme</hi> for any to be <hi>intire</hi> &amp; <hi>perfect</hi> in the Law, that is, to haue an indifferent &amp; vnpartiall reſpect vnto all the parts of Gods Law: for whoſoeuer is intire &amp; perfect in his obedience to Gods Law, he will ſanctifie his Sabbaths as one part of his Law, which theſe men muſt account for Iudaiſme: &amp; ſo much for proofe of the Maior.</p>
                        <p>I come now vnto th profe of the Minor, or ſecond propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: &amp; here I proue, that to ſanctify the 7th day Sabbath, is a parte of the Law: my firſt reaſon is, becauſe the Sanctification of the 7th day Sabbath, is as well &amp; as much commanded in the Law, as any other duetie therin mentioned is: for other dueties, are deliuered but in commanding termes, &amp; ſo is this: for the Lord ſaieth, <hi>But the 7th day is the Sabbath &amp;c. in it thou ſhalt not doe any worke.</hi> Where you ſee, that God expreſly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Time &amp; day, to wit, the 7th day: &amp; of this Time and day, hee ſaith, <hi>In it, thou ſhalt not doe any worke:</hi> ſo that God hath as well forbidden men, to labour &amp; worke vpon the 7th day; as he hath forbidden men, to kill, to Commit adultery, or to ſteale: and therefore the 7th day, &amp; the ſanctification of it, is no leſſe a parte of the Law, and may challeng it of right, then are the commandements of murther, adultery, &amp; ſtealing.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In a bond, there the debitor is bound vnto ij. things, the one is the ſumme of money, the other is the Time &amp; day when it muſt be paid; now will any man ſay, that the Time and day mentioned in the bond, is no parte of the bond? there is the ſame reaſon of the thinges in a bond, and of the things in the bond of the 4th com.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Iewes were commanded to circumciſe vpon the 8th day; &amp; to eate the paſſouer on the 14th day; now will any man thinke, that theſe <hi>daies</hi> commanded, were no partes of thoſe Commandements?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. An other reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to proue the time &amp; day to be a parte of the Law, is becauſe if it be taken away, then the Law is vnperfect

As hereby the Law is lamed in its words, ſo alſo is it in things; for, our new Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharians, when they haue aboliſhed the old Sabbath, the 7th day Sabbath, then they thinke the Law is imperfect, for it wanteth a day: &amp; therfore they haue patched it vp againe with a new day, to wit, the Lords day; ſaying, the 4th com. commandeth now the Lords day: wherefore, themſelues are my witneſſes, that the Time &amp; day, is a parte of the Law, and alſo a parte ſo neceſſary, as they hold the Lawe vnperfect, vntill they haue put in a new peece to make vp the breach: when a ſtud or pillar of an howſe is taken away, ſo as they muſt ſet in a new ſtud or pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar into its roome, then that old ſtud ſurely was in right account, a parte of the houſe; ſo is it here, ſince a new day muſt be put into the 4th com. in the roome of the old day, ſurely the old day was a parte of the 4th com. a man may therefore as well take away the ſtudes or pillars of an houſe, as aboliſh the 7th day Sabbath; and as the one tendeth to the ruine of the houſe, ſo the other tendeth to the ruine of the whole Law of God, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the 4th com.</p>

                        <p>I come now vnto the profe of the Minor, or ſecond propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, that Saturday the 7th day, is a 7th day, beſids which thereis no 7th day. For this purpoſe note, that a 7th day muſt be ſo accounted, either <hi>Naturally</hi> or <hi>Diuinly;</hi> firſt for the account
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:21140:226"/>Naturall, Saturday muſt needs be a 7th day naturally, beſids which there is none other 7th day: for Saturday is the 7th day from the Creation; and there is no 7th day beſids it from the Creation: now the account, which fet cheth its begining, from the Creation, that is the naturall account; becauſe time and dayes, begane at the begining of the Creation; and he that counteth daies in number as they were in being, he followeth the Naturall computation. Further, as Saturday is naturally the 7th day, beſids which there is none other: ſo Saturday is the 7th parte of time, in a naturall accounte, beſids which there is no 7th parte of time, this is very apparent at the firſt viewe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. For the account Diuine; Saturday muſt needs be a 7th day in Diuine account, beſids which there is none other 7th day: for the Scriptures (whoſe computation is Diuine) doe informe vs that Saturday is a 7th day; inaſmuch as they cale the day whereon Chriſt roſe, the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the weeke, Mat. 28.1. Mark. 16.2. &amp; that is our Sunday; now if Sunday be the firſt day of the weeke, in a Diuine account, then Saturday which went before it, or the Saturday which comes after it, muſt be the laſt, and a 7th day of the weeke, in a Diuine account: &amp; foraſmuch as the Scripture, accounteth no day, the firſt day of the weeke, but one, to wit, our Sunday; therefore beſids Saturday, there can be none other 7th day, in a Diuine accompt. Further, as Saturday is a 7th day, beſids which there is no 7th day, in a Diuine accompt; ſo is Saturday, the 7th parte of time, in a Diuine accompt, beſids which there is no 7th parte of time.</p>
                        <p>Thus you haue ſeene the Minor proued, to wit, that Saturday the 7th day, is a 7th day, beſids which there is no 7th day: and it is proued to be a 7th day, both in the account Naturall, &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine.</p>
                        <p>Further if we ſhall come to the computation of all <hi>Chriſtian Churches,</hi> whither Proteſtants or Papiſts, ſtill Saturday will be both the 7th day, beſide which there is no 7th day; &amp; alſo the 7th parte of time: for doe not all Churches, account our Lords day, or Sunday, for the firſt day of the weeke? if then Sunday be the firſt day, Saturday muſt be the 7th day: &amp; alſo, if there be no firſt day of the weeke but one, to wit; Sunday; then can there be
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:21140:227"/>no 7th day of the weeke but one, to wit, Saturday.</p>
                        <p>One thing be pleaſed to note, that ſince Saturday, is as well the onely 7th parte of time, as the onely 7th day, as appeareth formerly; therefore I might frame an other argument, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Saturday to be the Sabbath day: becauſe it is the onely 7th parte of time, as well as becauſe it is the onely 7th day, as thus, <hi>That day which is the 7th parte of time, beſids which there is no 7th parte of time; that day must be Sabbath day. But Saturday, is the 7th parte of time, beſids which there is no 7th parte of time. Therefore Saturday, must be our Sabbath day.</hi> Let me heere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of thoſe Diuines, who hold that a 7th parte of time, is to be conſecrated to Gods worſhip, as Morall; which time they would make to be the 7th parte of time, beſides our Saturday, which is the 7th day from the Creation? I deſire to know where they would begine, or which day, ſhall be their firſt parte of time, beſids our <hi>Sunday,</hi> which is the firſt day of the worlds Creation? it cannot enter into my head as yet, where they ſhould begine their account of time, vnleſſe it be from the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or from the <hi>Redemption;</hi> there is none other famouſe action in the world, that I can conceiue of, the which Chriſtians ſhould make their computation of time by, then theſe two, the Creation &amp; the Redemption: Now if they will account from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the Naturall account, yea or by the Diuine accompt, then Sunday muſt be the firſt parte of time, &amp; Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day muſt be the 7th parte of time: but if they will account from the Redemption; then ſuer I am in the firſt place, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make our Sunday or Lords day, which now we conſecrate to Gods worſhip, to be a 7th parte of time: &amp; ſecondly, if they will rekone our Lords day, to be the firſt day of the weeke and ſo the firſt day &amp; firſt parte of time, it being the firſt day of the Redemption, Then they muſt hould our Saturday to be the 7th parte of time, and ſo to be conſecrated to Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                        <p>Thus let them rekone either from the Creation, or from the Redemption, &amp; they muſt acknowledg Saturday to be the day, to be conſecrated to God.</p>
                        <p>It is meete, that all Diuines, who acknowledge a 7th parte
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:21140:227"/>of time, to be Gods, &amp; for his worſhip, (as I think the moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines doe) ſhould tell vs alſo, which is that day, &amp; which is that 7th parte of time, in particular, that ſo we may know it, and keepe it: &amp; it is meete alſo, that they tell vs, from whence they begine theire account, whither from the Creation, or Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or whence elſe; &amp; ſo ſhew vs which day is the firſt parte of time in their accompt.</p>
                        <p>Let me alſo demand, of all Diuines, who expound the 4th com. of a 7th day, which day of the weeke that a 7th day is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof they ſpeake? I deſire of them, that they ſhew vs, which day of the weeke, they will count for their firſt day of the 7, ſo ſhall we ſee where they will begine their account, whither from the Creation, or from the Redemption, or rather from neither of of them, but from ſome new deuiſe of their owne braine: ſuer I am, if they will follow that account which is naturall, or that which is Diuine, they muſt rekone our Sunday for their firſt day; &amp; then they muſt fale vpon Saturday for their 7th.</p>
                        <p>To conclude this argument, whereas all Proteſtant Diuines, that I either know, or heare of, doe maintaine theſe ij Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones; the one; that a 7th parte of time is Gods, to be conſecrated to his worſhip &amp; ſeruice: the other, that a 7th day is to be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified for a Sabbath day: whereas it is now diſcouered vnto them, that there is none other 7th parte of time, or 7th day, in any approued Authenticall accompt, beſides our Saturday the 7th day; my petition heere vnto them all is, that henceforth, they would imbrace, that auncient ordinance of God, the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath; or elſe, their owne Doctrine &amp; poſitiones, ſhall riſe vp in iudgement, againſt them.

                        <p>For profe of the Major, or firſt propoſition: The Almighty hath done many and maruailouſe workes in the world; hee hath done many <hi>Miracles;</hi> hee cauſed the <hi>Sea</hi> to diuid, &amp; ſtand vpon heapes, &amp; to be a wale on either ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, vntill his people went tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row on dry land: hee cauſed the <hi>Sunne</hi> to ſtand ſtill, in the mideſt of the heauens, for an whole day: hee cauſed the <hi>Earth</hi> to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quake, the <hi>Sunne</hi> to looſe hir light; &amp; many <hi>dead bodies</hi> of the Saints to awake, at the paſſion of our Lord Chriſt, with many other wonderfull miracles recorded in the Scriptures; but amongſt them all, there is none that doth excell this Myracle of Myracles, the <hi>Creation of the world,</hi> how well then doth it beſeeme vs, to keepe a memory of ſuch a myracle! for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ij. things are to be conſidered, the one is, that it is a duety which God requireth of vs, to <hi>magnify</hi> &amp; <hi>praiſe</hi> the name of God: and how ſhall we performe this better, then by keeping of a thankfull remembrance of Gods workes of wonder? The other is, that this myracle of the Creation, it is not like vnto many other myracles; for that of the diuiding of the Sea, it concerned the Iſralites onely and that of the Sunne its ſtanding ſtill, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned theſe times onely; but as for this of the Creation, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth vs, &amp; our times, euery way as much as it did the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites; for thers not a man, woman, or child amongſt vs, but hath its ſhare &amp; benefite from the Creation, as well as thoſe Iewes had, and therefore we in theſe daies, &amp; all people to this worlds end, haue and ſhall haue, as good cauſe, to keepe a thankfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Creation, as euer any nation or people had.</p>
                        <p>But if we ioyne both theſe together, as firſt, that it is a duty lying vpon vs, to magnify the name of God, in this his ſo greate
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:21140:228"/>a worke of wonder; &amp; ſecondly, that this ſo greate a worke, it doth redownd to the proffit and good of euery one amongſt vs; then what greate cauſe, and what iuſt cauſe is there, that euery one of vs, ſhould at this day, celebrate a thank full remembrance of the worke of Creation? Neither can I thinke, thers any man ſo vngratefull, as to deny vnto God a thankfull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this ſo greate worke, by meanes whereof we liue, and haue a being and all the creatures ſeruicable vnto vs, euen the Sunne it ſelfe to ſerue vs with hir light &amp; heate: whence I thus argue.</p>
                        <p>If it be our duety, &amp; alſo ſuch duety, as we freely doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge vnto God to keepe a thankfull remembrance of his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſe worke of Creation; why then ſhould any man deny vs the ſpeciall <hi>helpes,</hi> and needefull <hi>meanes,</hi> appointed of God, to keepe the memory of the Creation in his Church? there is nothing more abſurd, then to grant the performance of an holy action, to be due vnto God, &amp; yet to deny ſuch needfull and proffitable meanes, as God hath ordeined to that end: this were all one, as if we ſhould grante indede, that it is a duty, to keepe an holy remembrance of the death of our Lord Ieſus, and yet to deny the vſe of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes in the Church, which ſerue to put vs in minde thereof: in a word, it were to eparate the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes from the end, then the which nothing is more abſurde: wherefore, as we will approue &amp; teſtify our thankfulneſſe to God, for ſo greate a bleſſing, as the Creation is vnto vs; and as we deſire to giue God the glorie of his maruailouſe workes; ſo let vs be zealouſe to maintaine in the Church, all the meanes &amp; needfull helpes thereof.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it will appeare, that we in our times, haue as greate vſe &amp; neede, of meanes &amp; helpes, to keepe in memory, this greate worke of Gods Creation, as euer had the Iewes &amp; people of God, if not greater neede: for by nature, wee are as vngratfull, vnthankfull, and vnmindfull of Gods bleſſings and mercies receiued, as euer they were; &amp; we ſtand in as much neede as euer they did, to be ſtirred vp by all <hi>helpes</hi> &amp; <hi>meanes,</hi> to giue vnto God, the glorie due vnto his name, for his workes of wonder which he hath wrought: nay we ſtand in
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:21140:229"/>more neede now then they did then, by how much we liue in times longer and further off from the Creation then they did; for we are in more danger of ſleiting &amp; forgetting this greate benefit of the Creation, then were the Iſrael of God, becauſe they liued nere vnto it, and hard by it as it vvere, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of vs, vvho liue thowſands of yeeres after them: and vvho knovveth not, hovv ſoone things done long agone, ſlip out of memory? or if they ſlipp not quite out of memory, yet they lay there like the ingrauings vvritten vpon graue ſtons, vvhich by continuall trampling vpon, are vvell nigh worne out: it is needfull therefore that vve ſhould haue all meanes &amp; helpes, that may as it vvere daily new write, &amp; ingraue vpon out me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, the honourable memory, of the Myracle of Creation.</p>
                        <p>It may be ſome will anſwer thus, that the meanes once ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God, ought ſtill to be in vſe, if none other as fit may be found out: but other as fit for that vſe may be found out, as the Lords day: for herein we may keepe a memory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Againſt this I haue theſe reaſones 1. the Lords day, or Sunday is as vnfit to keepe memory of the Creation, as the Sabbath day, or Saturday is in their account, vnfit to keepe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Redemption. 2. the day which is ſet a parte to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the memory of the Creation, it muſt haue an apteneſſe in it by way of ſimilitude, to repreſent it vnto vs; like as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, haue apteneſſe in them, to repreſent vnto vs the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demtion: now God finiſhed his worke of Creation, and reſted on the 7th day or Saturday, and of all daies in the weeke, we haue none that hath ſuch ſimilitude and likneſſe to Gods 7th day, as is our Saturday, which is the ſame 7th day in order with Gods; &amp; therefore it is the onely fit day for this purpoſe: now the Lords day, is ſo farre from any ſimilitude with Gods reſting day which was on the 7th &amp; laſt day of the weeke Geneſ. 2, 3. as it is the firſt day, &amp; begining of the weeke. 3. ſuppoſe that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could invent ſome other day as fit as the 7th day appointed by God, will they reiect Gods choiſe for one of thir owne? could they ſhew vs ſome other day, as fit in Gods account, they ſhould ſpeake to ſome purpoſe, but to reiect that meanes appointed of God, becauſe they can find an other which pleaſeth them as
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:21140:229"/>well, is audaciouſe preſumption: why by like reaſon, may they not as well chang the Elementes in the Sacraments for others? as well may they reiect Chriſts choiſe, as Gods choiſe.</p>
                        <p>But happily ſome may obiect, that ſome helpes for the keeping in memory of the Creation, are aboliſhed, as for example the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day: for all Sabbaths are aboliſhed in Col. 2.16.17. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I anſwer, that the folly of this obiection hath formerly bene anſwered; here therefore a word or two ſhall be fufficient. 1. it is to be noted that the text Col. 2.16.17. ſpeaketh not of <hi>Signes,</hi> but of <hi>Shaddowes;</hi> &amp; as formerly it hath bene ſhowne, there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Signes &amp; ſhaddowes; wherefore this text is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently alleaged; for we haue here to doe with Signes, &amp; not with Shaddowes. 2. ſuppoſe we this text ſpake of Signes, yet it ſpake of ſuch Signes as had reſpect vnto Chriſt, <hi>which are a Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of things to come, the body whereof was Chriſt,</hi> as the text ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: ſo that theſe Sabbaths here aboliſhed, were onely ſuch Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths as had reſpect vnto Chriſt, &amp; to the Redemption; but we ſpeake of a Sabbath that was a ſigne of the Creation: therefore the Sabbath we heere ſpeake for, it differeth from thoſe Sabbaths, which the Apoſtle aboliſhed, as farre as the Creation differeth from the Redemption: &amp; this yet further appeareth in their text; for it ſpeaketh of a Shaddow <hi>of thinges to come,</hi> ſo that thoſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Sabbaths, had reſpect vnto things to come afterwards, as vnto Chriſt; but this Sabbath for which we plead, it was a ſigne of things paſt, &amp; done before, as of the Creation: ſo that this Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, differeth from thoſe aboliſhed Sabbaths, as farre as things paſt, doe differ from things to come: ſo then, it doth not appeare, that any thing once made an helpe, to keepe in memory the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was euer aboliſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="424" facs="tcp:21140:230"/>
                        <p> I come now vnto the profe of the minor, or ſecond propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, that the 7th day Sabbath, was a ſpeciall helpe &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to preſerue the memory of the Creation, in the Church of God, &amp; this I proue, becauſe the Sabbath day, was made a <hi>ſigne</hi> of the <hi>Creation;</hi> &amp; ſignes are helpes &amp; meanes, to keepe memory of thoſe things whereof they are ſignes: here then my taske is to proue vnto you, for the confirmation of my Minor, theſe two propoſitiones; the one, that the Sabbath day was once a ſigne of the Creation, the other, that ſignes are helpes &amp; meanes to keepe memory of the things they ſignify. For the former of theſe, to wit, that the Sabbath day was once a ſigne of the Creation. This I proue firſt by the Teſtimony of all men; and ſecondly by the Teſtimony of the Sriptures.</p>
                        <p>For the Teſtimony of men; that the 7th day Sabbath is a ſigne, this all of them grant, when they alleage that text Exod. 31.13. againſt the Sabbath, as an aboliſhed ſigne: further, that this ſigne reſpected the Creation, as the thing ſignified by it, is found to be the iudgement of Diuines, euery wherein their writings, as might be ſhowne, if it were needfull: yea, this is plaine by the common arguments in euery mans mouth; for when they would proue, that the Lords day muſt be a Sabbath, they thus argue, if the Iewes kept a Sabbath in memory of the Creation, then ſo ought we Chriſtians, to keepe a Sabbath in memory of the Redemption: &amp; againe, the Lords day was inſtituted (ſay they) in memory of the reſurrection, like as the Sabbath day, was inſtituted, for me mory of the Creation: by which kind of reaſoning they doe confeſſe it, that the Sabbath day was inſtituted, for the memory of the Creation.</p>
                        <p>So much for the Teſtimony of men: next I come to proue it by diuine Teſtimony from the Scripture: for this purpoſe ſee, Ex. 31.17. where the Lord ſpeakeing of our 6 daies labour, &amp; of our 7th day Sabbath, ſaith thus, <hi>It is a ſigne betwene mee &amp; the children of Iſrael for euer: for in ſixe daies the Lord made the heauen &amp; the earth, &amp; in the 7th day he ceaſed &amp; reſted,</hi> as if the Lord had thus ſaid, <hi>becauſe</hi> I laboured in the 6 daies at the Creation &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on the 7th day, therefore your 6 daies labour, &amp; 7th daies reſt, is a ſigne betwene mee &amp; you, of my 6 daies labour &amp; 7th
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:21140:230"/>daies reſt, thus the ſenſe muſt be rendered, if we take the words as they are tranſlated: but becauſe this kind of ſenſe making is difficult, &amp; not ſo familiar vnto our vnderſtandings, by reaſon the thing ſignified by the ſigne, is not expreſſed but collected; therefore to make the ſenſe of the text appeare more cleerly, it is better to put the word <hi>(that)</hi> in the roome of the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall partice <hi>(for)</hi> &amp; then the ſenſe will be very familiar &amp; eaſy: for ſo the thing ſignified by the ſigne, ſhall be expreſſed in the text; &amp; then the text ſhould be read thus, <hi>Jt is a ſigne betweene me and the children of Iſrael for euer (that) in ſixe daies the Lord made heauen &amp; earth, &amp; in the 7th day he ceaſed &amp; reſted.</hi> Thus you ſee it plaine, that as all men hold, the 7th day Sabbath, was kept in remembrance of the Creation, ſo this text confirmeth it, ſaying, that it is a ſigne (that) God laboured 6 daies &amp; reſted on the 7th day.</p>
                        <p>Now that this particle tranſlated (for) may be tranſlated (that) it appeareth. 1. By the Septuagint which rendereth it <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> which may be indifferently translated (for) or (that) according as may beſt fit the text. 2. In ſondry other textes our Translatores haue translated the ſame Hebrew word (that) rather then (for) as you may ſee Deut. 29.6. <hi>That yee may know</hi> (that) <hi>I am the Lord your God:</hi> Thus I haue proued the one of the propoſitiones, to wit, that the 7th day Sabbath was a ſigne of the Creation.</p>
                        <p>The other propoſition which I am to proue is, that Signes are helpes and meanes, to keepe in memory the things they ſignify: and this is ſo plaine, as I might ſpare the labour topro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue it: for it is the very nature &amp; propertie of a ſigne, to be a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to bring to minde the thing fignified by it, wherefore ſerues the picture of a mans abſent frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but to helpe to bring him to minde? The raine bowe in the clowds, it is called a ſigne or a token, Geneſ. 4.13. &amp; the Lord ſaid, he would looke vpon the bowe, that he might remember the Couea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which was the thing ſignified by the bowe, v. 16. The paſſeouer was a ſigne or toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which when the Angell ſaw, he reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred the Couenant, &amp; ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Iſralites, Exod. 12.13. The Lords Supper it is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſigne, &amp; it is of this vſe, to be an helpe &amp; meanes, to remember vs of the death of Chriſt. 1. Cor. 11.24. you may
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:21140:231"/>reade the like alſo in Gen. 17.11. &amp; Exo. 31.13. by all which in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtances it is plaine, that ſignes are helpes and meanes, to bring to mind, &amp; preſerue in memory, the thing abſent &amp; ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by thoſe ſignes.</p>
                        <p>Thus much for the Minor or ſecond propoſition; &amp; alſo for my 7th argument, whereby you haue ſeene it proued, that the 7th day Sabbath muſt ſtill be in force; becauſe it is a ſingular meanes to preſerue in memory the myraculouſe worke of Gods Creation.</p>

                        <p>My 8th argument, to proue that the 7th day Sabbath is ſtill in force, is becauſe God hath expreſly commanded it, in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law: &amp; thus it may be framed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Whatſoeuer God hath expreſly commanded to be done, in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, or 10 commandements, that is ſtill in force.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>But to ſanctify the</hi> 7th <hi>day Sabbath, God hath expreſly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to be done, in his Morall Law, or 10 commandements.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore to ſanctifie the</hi> 7th <hi>day Sabbath, is ſtill in force.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here I will begine with the minor or ſecond propoſition, prouing that firſt, becauſe it will be ſooneſt done: the point then I am to proue is, that God hath commanded the ſanctification of the 7th day Sabbath, in his morall Law, or 10 com. &amp; here firſt I will proue, that the Lord hath commanded the ſanctification of the Sabbath day: &amp; 2dly, that this Sabbath day is the 7th day: for the former, ſee Exod. 20.8. <hi>Remember the Sabbath day, to keepe it holy;</hi> or to ſanctifie it: where you ſee an expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement giuen, to Remember the Sabbath day; &amp; to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy it, or keepe it holy: &amp; ſo the former point is proued.</p>
                        <p>The next point to be proued, is that this Sabbath day, it was the 7th &amp; laſt day of the weeke, which is our Saturday: &amp; this I ſhall proue, firſt by humane Teſtimony; 2dly by Diuine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: for humane Teſtimony, 1. the <hi>Iewes</hi> whereſoeuer they liue, they kepe the 7th &amp; laſt day of the weeke, our Saturday, for this Sabbath day, here commanded, as it is well knowne. 2. All <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> both Proteſtants &amp; Papiſts confeſſe, that the 7th &amp; laſt day of the weeke, our Saturday, was the Sabbath day, commanded in the 4th com. which point, I haue inciſted more
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:21140:231"/>largly vpon, in the Expoſition of the 4th com.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall proue the ſame alſo, by Diuine Teſtimony, and that <hi>before</hi> the Law; <hi>at</hi> the giuing of the Law; &amp; <hi>after</hi> the giuing of the Law. 1. Before the giuing of the Law, ſee Exod, 16.26. <hi>Sixe dayes ſhall yee gather it, but in the 7th day is the Sabbath: in it there ſhall be none:</hi> So here you ſee, before the Law was giuen, by Sabbath day, was vnderſtod the 7th day. 2. At the giuing of the Law, ſee Exod. 20, 10. <hi>But the</hi> 7th <hi>day is the Sabbath of the Lord.</hi> So here at the giuing of the Law, was vnderſtod by Sabbath day, the 7th &amp; laſt day of the weeke. 3. After the giuing of the Law, ſee Exod. 23.12. <hi>Sixe daies thou ſhalt doe thy worke, and in the 7th day, thou ſhalt Rest.</hi> And ſee Exod. 31.15. <hi>Sixe daies ſhall men worke, but in the 7th day is the Sabbath of the holy Rest.</hi> See alſo Exod. 34.2. <hi>Sixe daies thou ſhalt worke, &amp; in the 7th day thou ſhalt Rest: both in earing time, &amp; in haruest.</hi> ſee alſo Leuit. 23.3. <hi>Sixe daies ſhall worke be done, but in the</hi> 7th <hi>day ſhall be the Sabbath of Reſt.</hi> And ſo it continued in the Church vntill Chriſts time, as you may ſee Luk. 13.14. yea, &amp; after Chriſts death, as you may ſee Mat. 28.1. Mark. 16.1.2. thus you haue ſeene it proued, that by the word (Sabbath) in the 4th com. God, and the Church of God, vnderſtod the 7th &amp; laſt day of the weeke: &amp; ſo you haue ſeene it proued, that God commanded the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the 7th day Sabbath, in his morall Law.</p>
                        <p>Now I come to the Major or firſt propoſition: the profe of this will coſt me longer time then the former, not but that it is as cleere as the former, but that men of peruerſe minds, haue wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bent their wites &amp; lerning againſt it, as they haue done againſt the former, but tis no matter, trueth ſhall preuaile, God aſſiſting it: the point then that I am to proue is this, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer God hath commanded in the Morall Law, or 10 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, it is ſtill in force, or now to be obſerued and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed: if they deny this Major, then I require them to giue me an inſtance to the contrary; let them ſhew me, where God hath commanded any thing to be done in the 10 commandements, which is aboliſhed &amp; not in force now, remembring that they bring not the thing in queſtion for their inſtance.</p>

<pb n="428" facs="tcp:21140:232"/>and ſo deny ſome parte of this Major, for example, ſometime they diſtinguiſh of the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; of the <hi>Accidentes:</hi> granting thoſe, denying theſe: by ſubſtance, they vnderſtand that which they pleaſe to make morall in the Decalogue, as the Reſt in the 4th com. &amp; the holy actiones of prayer, reading, &amp; preaching Gods word: by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, they vnderſtand that which they pleaſe to make ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall in the Decalogue, as the time of Gods worſhip, to wit, the 7th day: but this is a fooliſh diſtinction, and ſo much the more vile, in that it is made againſt God; for hath not God as well commanded the Accident, &amp; time, as the ſubſtance, and Reſt? &amp; is it not neceſſary to obey God, in one commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as well as in an other? for, the one is as well commanded as the other: did they diſtinguiſh betweene things <hi>commanded,</hi> &amp; things <hi>not commanded,</hi> it were tollerable, but they diſtinguiſh of things all of them commanded; as betwene <hi>great</hi> commandements, and <hi>little</hi> commandements; the one they cale ſubſtances, the other Accidents; now the greater commandementes which they cale ſubſtances, theſe they will imbrace; but as for the leſſer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, which they pleaſe to cale Accidents, theſe they will reiect &amp; deny; ſo then, Gods greater commandementes, they will obey; but as for his leſſer commandements, theſe they will not obey: &amp; that becauſe they are little, and light in their eſteeme; but our Sauiour Chriſt hath taught them an other leſſon, ſaying, whoſoeuer ſhall breake <hi>one of theſe leaſt commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> he ſhall be called the leaſt in the kingdome of heauen Mat. 5.19. Let them cale them Accidentes if they will, yet ſince they are commandements, they are not leſſe then the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, of which our Sauiour ſpeaketh.</p>
                        <p>That no diſtinction is to be receiued, whereby any thing inioyned in the 10 commandements is denyed, I thus further proue it. 1. this is a poſition ſo cleere, as the Sunne, that All Gods 10 commandements doe bind vs, to obedience of them, &amp; are ſtill in force: now if it be lawfull for any man, barely to deny this trueth, ſaying by way of anſwer, that ſome of his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements doe not bind vs to obedience; then euery priuate mans bare deniall, ſhall be as authenticall as this cleere trueth and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:21140:232"/>poſition; which is moſt abſurd: for thus a froward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary may put a man to bring a light cleerer then the Sunne, that is, hee may put him to proue whither any of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandementes doe binde vs now or not: for example, a Miniſter reproueth an adulterer, from the 7th commandement; &amp; thus he frameth his argument againſt him.</p>
                        <p>All the 10 commandements doe bind vs &amp;c. But the 7th com. is one of the 10 commandements &amp;c. Shall it be lawfull for this vncleane perſon, to deny the Major in ſome parte of it, by a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; put the Miniſter to proue, that All the 10 commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe bind vs? what an impiouſe and vngodly anſwer were this? why this is our caſe; for in my Major I affirme, that all the 10 commandements doe bind vs to obedience; &amp; they make this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly anſwer, by a diſtinction, that all of them doe not bind vs; &amp; will put me to proue, that they doe bind vs.</p>
                        <p>If this anſwer be lawfull, why may not <hi>Papiſts</hi> deny that the 2d com. bindeth vs, or that it is ſtill in force, ſaying, the 2d com. tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Images, it is Iewiſh, &amp; concerned the Iewes onely, and that it forbad onely Iewiſh Images; &amp; that it concerneth not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, &amp; Chriſtian Images? &amp; why may not Anabaptiſtes, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines, &amp; our new ſprung vp Eatoniſtes, deny the whole Law, euen all the 10 commandementes, &amp; that vpon plauſible pretenſes alſo?</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, ſuch diſtinctiones are <hi>Blaſphemouſe;</hi> &amp; therefore to be reiected: for, to deny that any thing commanded by God, in his 10 com. both bind vs to obedience; is to deny, that Gods will ſhould be obeied by vs; to reiect his Soueraignty &amp; gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; &amp; as much as if we ſhould ſay, we will not, that God ſhall Raigne ouer vs. is it not Blaſphemy, when the Creatour ſhall ſay, doe this, &amp; the creature ſhall anſwer, He will not? thus doe they, who by diſtinctions, will reiect any one thing, commanded in the 10 commandements.</p>
                        <p>Further ſuch anſwers as by diſtinctions, deny any one thing, commanded in the 10. commandements, doe plainly bewray the Authoures thereof, to be profeſſed enemies, to the <hi>Integrity</hi> &amp; <hi>perfection</hi> of God Lawe; and would that God ſhould be ſerued
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:21140:233"/>but by halues &amp; by peecemeale; and therefore, their ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctiones are vnſound, &amp; to be reiected by all men fearing God, &amp; louing the Lawes of God.</p>
                        <p>Such anſwers are to be reiected, and men are ſolely to reſt contented with this, that it is commanded in the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> without demaunding any other proofes my reaſon hereof is, becauſe neither better proofes, nor of higher authority, can be poſſibly produced for the profe of any doctrine in Diuinity: for vvhat better proofe, can any man bring, or any Chriſtian man expect, then Gods commandements? &amp; amongſt all Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, then his 10 Morall commandements? there is no Scripture of higher Authority, then the Morall Lavv.</p>
                        <p>The 10 Commandements, the Creede, and the Lords prayer, theſe of all other Scriptures, are holden as <hi>principles</hi> of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion: now how abſurd a thing it is, for any to deny <hi>principles</hi> in any Arte, let all men iudge that haue any ſkill in Artes: A man may as vvell be permitted by a diſtinction to deny that euery one of the 6 petitiones of the Lords prayer, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto vs; or that ſome of the Articles of our faith, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto vs vpon ſome plauſible reaſones forged, as by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to deny that whatſoeuer is commanded in the 10 commandements doth belong vnto vs.</p>
                        <p>Thus I haue proued, that it is vnſufferable in A <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> that any man ſhould vſe a diſtinction or deniall, againſt this Orthodox &amp; moſt cleere trueth, that <hi>all things commanded in Gods 10 commandements are in force, &amp; doe binde vs to obedience.</hi> for this cauſe, I neede not procede any further, for the proofe of this Major &amp; orthodox trueth: for, if it be ſo cleere &amp; vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable a trueth, as no man may deny it, then I may very well ſpare the proofe of it: Neuertheleſſe, for the truethes ſake, &amp; for its further confirmation, I will proue it vnto you, by many and ſondry arguments: but by the way, one thing firſt, I would ſhould be taken into conſideration, which is this, that <hi>Diuines</hi> and all others, who are enemies vnto this moſt auncient ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, of Gods <hi>Sabbath,</hi> they are driuen to ſhrowd themſelues, from the force of this my 8th Argument, by this abominable &amp; vngodly anſwer, ſaying, that <hi>all Gods commandements doe not
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:21140:233"/>binde vs to obedience;</hi> or, that <hi>ſome of the 10 commandements, doe not bind vs to the obedience of them:</hi> nay, they muſt hold, if they aboliſh the 7th day Sabbath, that it is a <hi>ſinne</hi> for vs to yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto all the 10. commandements, &amp; that it is <hi>Iudaiſme:</hi> I deſire that all men would take ſpeciall notice of this abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dety that ſo they may ſee what rockes, theſe are forced to rune vpon, who deny the Lords Sabbaths.</p>
                        <p>Should common people make ſuch anſwers, they deſerued but a common cenſure, but if Miniſters; yea Puritane Miniſters ſhall make ſuch vngodly anſwers, what cenſure are they worthy of? I haue greate reaſon to vrge this point; becauſe if they grant me this trueth, to wit, that all Gods commandementes doe binde vs to obedience, the which no man fearing God can deny, then of neceſſity they muſt grant me, that the old Sabbath is ſtill in force, becauſe it is one of Gods commandements.</p>
                        <p>An other thing I deſire ſhould be taken into conſideration, is that ſuch as deny any thing in my Major by any diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſo they may deny Gods 7th day Sabbath, they rune into theſe <hi>other abſurdeties,</hi> 1. they hereby doe <hi>deface</hi> Gods royall Law, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a Morall-ceremoniall Law, an euerlaſting-temporary Law, &amp; a very Monſtre. 2. They draw vs to Anabaptiſtry, &amp; prophaneſſe, that ſo we ſhould haue none of Gods. Sabbaths. 3. They make an auncient &amp; holy prayer of our Church, a mere babling with God: to wit, that prayer added to the 4th com. in the Congregation. 4. As the Sabbath is Gods <hi>ordinance,</hi> ſo the Decalogue is Gods <hi>Law:</hi> now were men profeſſed enemies to <hi>God,</hi> then if they ſhould doe what in them is, to aboliſh his <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi> &amp; to reiect as much of his <hi>Law</hi> as poſſibly they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe, it were, but ſutable to their profeſſion: but that wee, who are profeſſed frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to God &amp; to his Law, that wee (I ſay) ſhould reiect, &amp; deſire to reiect as much of Gods Law, as poſſibly by any wite we can deuiſe, this is abhominable: &amp; ſo I come to make profe of the point.</p>
                        <p>That all Gods commandements are now to be obſerued and obeied: I proue it by Teſtimony <hi>humane,</hi> &amp; <hi>Diuine:</hi> for humane Teſtimony, the firſt ſhall be that of Reuerent <hi>Perkines,</hi> who writing againſt our common aduerſary the Papiſt, he vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:21140:234"/>to proue, that the religion of the Church of Rome agreeth to the corruption of mans nature: amongſt many other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he ſheweth how that Papiſts doe repeale &amp; make of none effect, all the 10 commandements of the Morall-Law: and to this purpoſe he begineth on this wiſe, <hi>The morall Law contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect righteouſneſse, is flat oppoſite to mans corrupt nature: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoeuer religion ſhall repeale and make of none effect the commandements of the Morall Law; the ſame religion muſt needs ioyne hands with the corruption of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s nature, &amp; ſtand for themainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of it. This doth the Religion of the Church of Rome: it may beit doth not plainly repeale them, yet in effect it doth, and if it ſhall fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate but any one point, of any one commandement, yea, the whole Law thereby is made vaine.</hi> Perkines, in his firſt volume, pag. 400. vnder the title, <hi>A papiſt cannot goe beyond a reprobate.</hi> I deſire that theſe his words may be weighed; where he ſaith, thar if the religion of the Church of Rome, ſhall fruſtrate <hi>but any one pointe, of any one comman.</hi> It doth thereby make fruſtrate the <hi>whole Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now a double vſe I may make of theſe words, the one is, that all Gods commandements are now to be obſerued and obeyed: becauſe hee ſaith, that not ſo much as any one point, of any one commandement is to be fruſtrated; &amp; further he addeth for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation thereof, that the aboliſhing of any one point, in the 10 commandements, it is the aboliſhing of the whole Law alſo; and ſo he hath confirmed my Major. The other vſe I make of theſe his words is, by his Teſtimony, to confute the madneſſe of ſuch Diuines, as deny the Integrity and perfection of Gods Law, &amp; therefore invent diſtinctiones, whereby they may curtaile the law, denying that whatſoeuer is commanded in the 10 com, doth belong vnto our practiſe; which is the abſurdety confuted in the laſt point handled before this; for the further confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let it be obſerued, that Learned <hi>Perkines</hi> ſaith that, that <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which fruſtrateth but <hi>any one point, of any one cemmandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> it doth thereby <hi>fruſtrate the whole law;</hi> let theſe Diuines then ſee into what a ſnare they are falne, by denying <hi>ſome on point, in ſome one comman.</hi> to wit, the Lords 7th day, Saturday Sabbath, for hereby they pull vpon, not themſelues alone, but vpon our Chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, this guilt, to wit, that by ſo doeing, it doth
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:21140:234"/>aboliſh the <hi>whole Law, &amp; ioyne hands with corrupt nature.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And further, hence it is, that he hath put vpon the tope of thoſe leaues in his booke, this title, <hi>A Papiſt cannot goe beyond a reprobate.</hi> If then a Papiſt cannot goe beyond a reprobate, if he fruſtrateth but one point, of any one commandement; then tell me, how farre ſome Proteſtant Diuines, can goe beyond reprobates, who doe fruſtrat this ancient ordinance of Gods Sabbath, expreſly commanded in the 10 commandements, and that after ſufficient meanes of light afforded them, by my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer booke? I wiſh thoſe tenn Miniſters, againſt whom eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially I write, to note this point: happily they will ſleite my iudgement, but <hi>M. Perkins</hi> iudgement, I know they reuerence: and further, if this be good Diuinity againſt Papiſts, I truſt it cannot be bade, when applied to Proteſtantes: theſe are not my collectiones, you ſee they are made by a man of their owne ſide.</p>
                        <p>Vnto the Teſtimony of M. Perkines, let me add the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Vrſinus</hi> who ſheweth ſondry differences, betwixt the Doctrine of the true Church, and the Doctrine of other Sectes &amp; Religiones; one of the differences is this, <hi>In Eccleſia lex Dei integra &amp; incorrupta retinetur: aliae Religiones &amp; ſectae legem Dei mutilant vel corrumpunt.</hi> Vrſi. Catechiſ. Pag. 4. <hi>Jn the Church (ſaith he) the Law of God is preſerved intirly and vncorrupted, but other Sectes &amp; Religiones doe lame or corrupt the Law of God.</hi> In which words as you ſee, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus</hi> doth lay it downe as a propertie of the <hi>true Church,</hi> to preſerue Gods Law in its integrity and perfection; &amp; as a marke of a <hi>falſe Church</hi> to lame &amp; detracte from Gods Law: By which words, hee plainly ratifieth all the 10 commandements, with whatſoeuer is therein commanded: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be a marke of a falſe Church, &amp; of Sectaries, to lame Gods Law, what reproch &amp; danger, doe ſuch Miniſters bring our <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; ſpecially themſelues into, by denying, that all the things commanded in the 10 commandements are in force, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vs to obedience? doe they not what lieth in them, labour to make our Church noe true Church? &amp; themſelues Sectaries?</p>
                        <p>Take alſo the Teſtimony of <hi>Polanus,</hi> in his <hi>Syntag. Theolog. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 10, <hi>de lege Dei. Pag. 353.</hi> who hauing to doe againſt
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:21140:235"/>
                           <hi>Papists,</hi> that ſay, the 2d com. againſt Images, belonged onely vnto Iewes, not vnto Chriſtians (as many Proteſtantes, ſay of the 4th com. touching the olde Sabbath) hee proueth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, by this argument: <hi>quia ad Christianos totus Decalogus pertinet, becauſe the whole Decalogue appertaineth vnto Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> If this reaſon be good againſt Papiſts, it cannot be bad with Proteſtants.</p>
                        <p>In the 4th place, I will proue it from their owne mouthes: for theſe which are ſuch notoriouſe enemies, to the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, they doe frequently in theire pulpites, reproue the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, the thiefe, the falſwitneſſe bearer, the Blaſhemer of Gods name, &amp; the reſt, by the Lawof the 10 commandements, ſaying, theſe deedes, are ſinnes, &amp; liable to condemnation, and muſt be refrained &amp;c. <hi>Becauſe</hi> they are forbidden in the Law of God: which kind of arguing, doth receſſarily imply thus much, that whatſoeuer thing is commanded or forbidden in the Law, is in force ſtill, &amp; doth bind vs now to obedience: the reaſon of this conſequence is, becauſe there is one and the ſame reaſon for all &amp; for euery thing, which there is for any one thing; for if Gods writeing &amp; commanding any one thing in his Law, be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon to incline our hartes, vnto the obedience thereof, then the ſame reaſon will moue vs to the obedience of euery thing, which is therein written; becauſe God hath as well writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten &amp; commanded euery thing therein, as any thing: and thus you ſee, how it neceſſarily followeth from their owne mouthes, that becauſe they cale for obedience now, vnto ſome things which God hath commanded in his Law, <hi>becauſe</hi> hee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them; that therefore they muſt yeeld, that all things in Gods Law, muſt now be obeyed; <hi>becauſe</hi> hee hath commanded them all: wherefore, ſince they teach this vnto the people, they muſt grant it me heere. Thus you haue heard this trueth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, both by ſome particular perſones of note, &amp; alſo by the mouthes of all my aduerſaries.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. I will proue it vnto you by the Teſtimony of our <hi>Church:</hi> In the order for the Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, or holy communion, ſet downe in the booke of <hi>Common prayer,</hi> it is thus ordered by our Church, <hi>Then ſhall the Miniſter rehearſe
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:21140:235"/>distinctly all the tenn commandements, &amp; the people kneeling ſhall after euery commandement, aske God mercy, for their tranſgreſſion of the ſame:</hi> &amp; againe, after that all the 10 commandements be rehearſed by the Miniſter, it is ordered, that the people ſhall all conclude, with this holy prayer, <hi>Lord haue mercy vpon vs, and write all theſe, thy lawes in our hearts, wee beſeech thee.</hi> In which holy ordinance of our Church, we may obſerue theſe things; 1. that our Church maintaineth the Law of Gods 10 commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as now in force; becauſe we are to aske God mercy for the tranſgreſſion of them; and becauſe we deſire God to write them in our heartes. 2 obſerue, that our Church ratifieth, not ſome onely of the 10 com. but all of them, euen euery comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement which was written in Tables of ſtone: for the Miniſter muſt rehearſe diſtinctly, all the tenn commandement; and the people are taught to pray to God, to write <hi>all theſe lawes</hi> in their heartes. Thus you ſee, our Church doth ratify and confirme, all the lawes of God, written in the Tables of ſtone, as they are rehearſed by the Miniſter, without mutilating or curtailing of any of them: they are no children of the Church therefore, who deny my Major, and thus I haue abundantly proued the point, by humane Teſtimony, and ſo I come to proue it alſo by Diuine Teſtimony.</p>
                        <p>But me thinke, euer &amp; anone as I am writing, that ſome body ſhould wonder at me, that I ſhould ſpend ſo many words, to proue a point ſo plaine as this, that all Gods commandements are now to be obeyed: why may they ſay, it is a point we neuer till now heard doubted of, we euer tooke it as an Article of our faith, that all things commanded in the Morall Law, did binde vs to the obedience thereof; and is it now become a queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Diuines? if this principle be doubted of now, we ſhall ſcarce know what to doe in Religion, &amp; what not to doe, what to beleeue, &amp; what not to beleeue; but ſurely Sir you are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, thers no Miniſter that hath any feare of God before his eyes, that will doubt of this point; and for common people, they are as farre from doubting of it, as the heauens are from the earth. Wherevnto I anſwer, that when I ſeriouſly enter into the conſideration of it, it maketh my very heart to tremble within me, to thinke that any man that profeſſeth godlineſſe,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:21140:236"/>ſhould be ſo farre in loue with old errour, as to deny ſo cleere a trueth as this; neuertheleſſe, not onely Miniſters, but puritane Miniſters goe about to doubt of and deny this trueth; for by their diſtinctiones, they will deny, that all the commandements written in the Decalogue, doe binde vs to obedience: which if they did not deny, I ſhould ſaue this labour; &amp;, they muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that moſt ancient ordinance of Gods Sabbath day; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good Reader wonder not at me, but rather wonder at ſuch your Miniſters, who are become ſo vnfaithfull to God, as that rather then they will confeſſe an old errour, they will ſtifly deny a manifeſt trueth.</p>
                        <p>My firſt argument then, of Diuine authority is this, that euery thingonce commanded in the Morall Law, ſtandeth ſtill <hi>vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed,</hi> &amp; is therefore ſtill in force. For theſe enemies to Gods Sabbaths, they cannot proue, that any <hi>one</hi> thing, once comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Decalogue, was euer ſince <hi>reuoked</hi> &amp; aboliſhed: now whatſoeuer thing, God hath once commanded, in his 10 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that thing is to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d euerlaſtingly, vnleſſe it can be ſhowne, that God hath reuoked &amp; reuerſed it: like as <hi>Statute Lawes</hi> in our Realme, though made long ſince, are neuertheleſſe in force ſtill, vnleſſe it can be ſhowne, that they haue bene repealed ſince, by the ſame Authority that firſt inacted them.</p>
                        <p>For the further ſtrengthening of which argument, let theſe Scriptures be perpended, <hi>What ſoeuer things are written afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time are written for our lerning, that we through patience &amp; comforte of the Scriptures might haue hope,</hi> Rom. 15.4. and againe, <hi>For the whole Scripture is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, &amp; is proffitable to teach, to convince, to correct, &amp; to inſtruct in righteouſneſſe</hi> &amp;c. 2. Tym. 3.16. In which two portiones of Scripture, you ſee, the Apoſtle doth ratify, an <hi>vninerſallity</hi> of things written in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and an <hi>Integrity</hi> and wholeneſſe of the Scriptures of the old Teſtament; now if we ſhall not apply theſe ij. textes to the maintenance of the Morall Law, or 10 commandements, to maintaine the vniuerſallity of all things written in the 10 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and to maintaine the <hi>Integrity</hi> perfection &amp; wole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the 10 commandements, then wherevnto ſhall we apply them? for what portion of Scripture is there, beſids this Law,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:21140:236"/>in all the old Teſtament, whereof it cane beſaid, that <hi>all things</hi> therin written, concerne our practiſe? &amp; that, that <hi>whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is proffitable to teach vs, to convince vs, to correct vs, and to inſtruct vs? What ſcriptures of the old Teſtament (I ſay) <hi>can be the adaequate</hi> Subiect or Obiect, of theſe ij. Scriptures, but the morall Law?</p>
                        <p>My 2d argument, to proue that all the 10 commandements, and euery commandement therin, doe bind vs ſtill to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of them, is this: that the Apoſtle S. Paul doth ratifie this Law, in the new Teſtament; ſaying, <hi>Doe we then make the Law, of none effect through faith? God forbid, yea, wee eſtabliſh the Law,</hi> Rom. 3.31. Where you ſee the Apoſtle affirmeth, that hee did eſtabliſh the Law: now the word Law in this text, is not to be reſtrained to ſome partes of it onely, but to be taken in the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſenſe, ſeeing thers nothing in the context to hinder it, now this Law is knowne to containe 10 commandements, <hi>Then he wrote vpon the Tables, according to the firſt writing, the tenne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements</hi> Deut. 10.4. the which were numbered by God, leaſt the number thereof ſhould be diminiſhed by me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; againe, <hi>Curſed is euery man, that continueth not in all things which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the booke of the Law, to doe them</hi> Gal. 3.10. Here againe, all things written in the Law, are ratified.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, S. Iames thus writeth, <hi>whoſoeuer ſhall kepe the whole Law, &amp; yet faileth in one point, hee is guilty of all.</hi> Iam. 2.10. In which words, S. Iames ratifieth all the Law, or the <hi>whole Law.</hi> ſo then S. Paul hath ratified the Law in its <hi>generality;</hi> &amp; S. Iames in its <hi>Integrity,</hi> yea, S. Iames goeth further, &amp; ratifieth all and euery parte &amp; pointe of the Law, in as much as, he would not haue vs <hi>faile,</hi> in any <hi>one point</hi> of it, as the text ſpeaketh: yet further, ſee what our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith touching this matter, <hi>whoſoeuer therefore ſhall breake one of theſe least commandements, &amp; teach men ſo, he ſhall be caled the leaſt in the Kingdome of heauen,</hi> Mat. 5.19. Here then our Sauiour ratifieth, &amp; that to the worlds end, as you may ſee in the verſe before, v. 18. the very leaſt thing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the 10 commandements.</p>
                        <p>In all which Scriptures you haue ſeene. 1. That the Law is ſtill inforce, 2. That all things written in this Law, are ſtill in force.
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:21140:237"/>3. That the wholl Law is ſtill in force 4. That the very leaſt thing commanded in the law is ſtill in force; what can be deſired more?</p>
                        <p>My 3d argument, to proue that euery commandement in the Decalogue, doth bind vs to obedience is becauſe God hath <hi>ioyned</hi> the commandements togeather: now that which our Sauiour ſaith in an other caſe, is true in this alſo, <hi>Let no man put a ſunder that, which God hath coupled together,</hi> Mat. 19.6.

                        <p>For the further ſtrengthening of this my 3d argument, let me relate vnto you, a notable obſeruation of lerned <hi>Iunius,</hi> which I find recorded by <hi>D. W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="439" facs="tcp:21140:237"/>and prolation of the word: The other ſhewing the coniunction &amp; cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the matter.</hi> The thing of note to be obſerued, in this obſeruation of learned <hi>Iunius</hi> is this, that God hath added one <hi>accent,</hi> to the writing of euery word, in the 10 commandements extraordinarily, ſo as the like is not found in the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, which is a moſt remarkable thing: now the vſe of this rare &amp; extraordinary <hi>accent</hi> is, as ſaith the ſame <hi>Iunius,</hi> to ſhew vnto vs, that the <hi>matters</hi> &amp; <hi>things</hi> conteined in thoſe ſeuerall words, are conioyned and coupled together by God, as well as the words.</p>
                        <p>Now howeuer there is an exception, in three verſes, as in v. 7.12.17. that is, in the third, fifth, &amp; tenth commandements, yet in the 4th com. thers no exception; for he giueth inſtances in the 4th com. for one of thoſe, which haue this double accent: the conſideration whereof, is of notable vſe for our purpoſe: for, whereas the aduerſaries to Gods Sabbaths, could be content to allow, all things in the 10 commandements, to be euer laſtingly coupled together, ſo they might caſt away that ſacred time, ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by God, the 7th day, heere therefore it hath pleaſed God, to be mindfull of his 4th com: &amp; of his ſacred time, aboue the 3d, 5th, &amp; 10th commandements: for this 4th com. hath its double accent, as well as any other: wherefore, ſuch Miniſters as would <hi>diuide</hi> betwixt the <hi>time,</hi> in the 4th com. and the <hi>dueties</hi> in the time; imbracing the one, reiecting the other, they are hereby corrected by God: for the Almightie hath ſhowne vnto vs, by this rare &amp; extraordenary <hi>accent,</hi> that the things ſpecified in his 4th com. ſhould goe hand in hand euerlaſtingly together; ſo as he that imbraceth the dueties in the time, he muſt imbrace alſo the time with the dueties.</p>
                        <p>My 4th &amp; laſt argument, to proue that euery commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Law doth binde vs now to the obedience thereof is, becauſe God ſpake euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement in the Law, as well as any one therein: ſee Exod. 20.1. <hi>God ſpake all theſe words &amp;c.</hi> Now wherefore is this praeface ſet before all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but to giue <hi>aequall</hi> authority vnto them all? &amp; to this end, that whoſoeuer, wherſoeuer, or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer any of theſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements are receiued, then, &amp; there, &amp; by the ſame perſones, all
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:21140:238"/>of them muſt be imbraced? becauſe God ſpake them all; and gaue alike authority, vniuerſality, perpetuity, &amp; morality, vnto all: to this purpoſe, <hi>M. Dod</hi> ſpeaketh excellently, in his worke vpon the commandements, in his expoſition of theſe words of the preface <hi>(all theſe words)</hi> pag. 9, <hi>God (ſaith hee) ſpake not the firſt commandement onely, nor the ſecond, or third, &amp; left there: But hee ſpake them all; &amp; gaue as ſtrict a charg to keepe euery one, as any one; &amp; no one was vttered by Gods voyce, or writte with his owne finger, more then the other: whence is to be learned, that whoſoeuer will haue any true comfort by his obedience vnto Gods Law, he muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelfe to looke to one, or to two; but muſt make conſcience, and haue a care to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all &amp; euery one: becauſe he that is the Author of one, hee is the Author alſo of all the reſt &amp;c.</hi> Where you ſee, M. Dod collecteth this, that obedience muſt be giuen to <hi>euery</hi> thing commanded, becauſe they all had one &amp; the ſame Authour: God ſpake them all.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, that this kind of arguing is ſound, I proue it by S. Iames, who vſeth the ſame kind of arguing: for hee, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing men of the ſinne of reſpect of perſones, and endeauor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to proue, that he that faileth in one point of the Law, he is guilty of all the points in the law, fetcheth his argument (as I conceiue of it) from the <hi>preface</hi> to the commandements, <hi>God ſpake all theſe words</hi> Exod. 20.1. &amp; thus he argueth, <hi>for he that ſaid, thou ſhalt not commit adultery, ſaid alſo; thou ſhalt not kill: now though thou doeſt none adultery yet if thou killest, thou art a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsour of the Law.</hi> Iam. 2.11. In which words you ſee, S. Iames argueth thus, that he that faileth in one precept of the tenn, he is guilty of all the reſt; &amp; his reaſon is, becauſe God <hi>ſpake</hi> them all; or, becauſe he that <hi>ſaid</hi> the one precept, hee it was that <hi>ſaid</hi> the others alſo: now if this his reaſon, had not bene generally true of all the things commanded in the Decalogue, it had bene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to proue what he would: for an inſtance to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary might haue bene brought thus: it followeth not Iames, that if one offend in one point, he is guilty of all; becauſe God ſpake all: for example, God ſpake that parte of the 4th com. <hi>but the 7th day is the Sabbath,</hi> &amp; yet he that offends in ſome other point is not guilty of this: becauſe this is abrogated. Wherefore, either
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:21140:238"/>we muſt graunt S. Iames to be of iudgement, that euery thing inioyned in the Decalogue is ſtill in force; or elſe his argument is vaine.</p>
                        <p>For concluſion of this argument, I make mine Appeale, vnto the conſcience of my Reader, &amp; vnto the conſcience alſo of the aduerſaries of Gods Sabbath, if they doe not finde the Spirit of God, ſecretly mouing them to thinke, that all things comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded among the Morales, ſhould be morall; &amp; that all precepts which <hi>God</hi> ſpake, &amp; wrote, ſhould be more laſting &amp; durable in the Church, then thoſe precepts which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake, &amp; wrote: &amp; if they find it thus, as I verily beleeue they cannot but find it thus, then let them beware of quenching the Spirit, &amp; to ſay or doe ought againſt the light of conſcience: for, at the day when God ſhall iudge the ſecretes of men, their conſciences will beare witneſſe, &amp; their thoughtes accuſe or excuſe them Rom. 2.15.</p>

                        <p>My 9th argument, to proue that the 7th day Sabbath is ſtill in force, is becauſe vnleſſe it be in force, the whole 4th com. with euery parte &amp; percell of it is aboliſhed, nullified, &amp; alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vſeleſſe. And thus it may be framed.</p>

                           <hi>If the 7th day Sabbath be not now in force; Then is the whole 4th com. nullified &amp; altogether vſeleſse.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>But the 4th com. is not nullified, &amp; become vſeleſſe. Therefore is the 7th day Sabbath now in force.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt a word or two of the minor or ſecond propoſition; for the trueth of it, namely that the 4th com. is now in force, this is plaine, firſt by the Teſtimony of our Sauiour, who ratifieth the very <hi>leaſt of the commandements,</hi> as you may ſee Math. 5.19. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is ratified by our Church, which hath ordered, that the 4th com. be reade in our Churches, &amp; alſo, that the people ſhall vſe this prayer, at the rehearſall of it by the Miniſter, <hi>Lord haue mercy vpon vs, and incline our hearts to keepe this Law.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I know no Diuine, one or other that denieth it, or doubteth of it; &amp; it were heinouſe impiety, for any to deny it; for it were to deny one of the tenn Morall Lawes, of Almighty God. So much therefore for profe of the Minor.</p>
                        <p>I come then vnto the Major or firſt propoſition; wherein I
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:21140:239"/>affirmed that the aboliſhing of the 7th day Sabbath, doth draw after it, the nullifying of the whole 4th com. &amp; now I proue it. In the 4th com. are ij things to be conſidered, the one is the commandement it ſelfe; the other is the reaſon of the com. and I ſhall proue, that both theſe are nullified by aboliſhing of the 7th day Sabbath, or by denying that the 7th day Sabbath is ſtill in force.</p>
                        <p>To begine with the commandement it ſelfe: that I may ſhewhow this is nullified, firſt we muſt ſee what it is which they deny; namely the 7th day Sabbath; in which words we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that they deny the Sabbath day, that is, the old Sabbath day, to be in force now: &amp; then we will conſider how they deny the 7th day, that is, the 7th day from the Creation, to be in force now: for both theſe they doe deny, in denying that the 7th day Sabbath is now in force: of theſe two I will begine with the Sabbath day, that is, the old Sabbath day; which they doe deny by theſe textes Exod. 31.13. &amp; Col. 2.16.17. now I proue, that if the old Sabbath day ſpecified in the 4th com. be aboliſhed, &amp; not in force now, then is the 4th com. made nonſenſe, and to ſtand for a Cipher: and that this may appeare, you ſhall ſee it made plaine to your very eyeſight.</p>
                        <p>The Lord God ſaid, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day, to ſanctify it</hi> Exod. 20.8. Now the Sabbath day here mentioned, it was the old Sabbath day; but this old Sabbath day (ſay theſe new Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batharians) is aboliſhed, &amp; not in force now; which if it be ſo, then in this commandement Exod. 20.8. the Lord God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth now at this time, iuſt nothing at all; for, take away theſe ij words <hi>Sabbath day</hi> from out the commandement, and in ſteade thereof, put ſo many Ciphers, as you haue letters in the two words, as you may doe, if thoſe words, or the thing meante by thoſe words, be aboliſhed, &amp; then the commandement is no more but thus much, <hi>Remember the 0000000000, to ſanctify it:</hi> Thus you ſee by deniall of the old Sabbath day, they haue made the word of God of none effect, &amp; Gods commandement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nonſenſe, and a bundle of Ciphers: &amp; this muſt be ſo, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they can ſhew vs, that God commanded vs, two Sabbath dayes, in his 4th com. the one, caled <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> the other,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:21140:239"/>caled <hi>Lords day:</hi> which all the Logick in their heads can neuer doe. And ſo much for their deniall of the Sabbath day.</p>
                        <p>I come now vnto the other thing that they deny, to wit, the 7th day, from the creation: &amp; in this I will conſider aparte theſe ij. things; firſt the word <hi>day,</hi> &amp; then the word <hi>Seauenth:</hi> firſt for the word day: they ſay that the day, to wit, the old day is aboliſhed, &amp; as by other textes, ſo alſo by theſe textes, Rom. 14.5, &amp; Gal. 4.10. ſecondly for the word Seauenth, they ſay that the 7th day in order of time is aboliſhed, to wit, the 7th day from the Creation, whence it followeth. 1. That if the day be aboliſhed, then is there no day now inioyned in the 4th com. for, take away that day which was commanded, to wit, the old day, &amp; then is there now no day required for a Sabbath in the 4th com. ſo then, now an howre in a day may be ſufficient, for a Sabhath; &amp; ſo a Sabbath day may be turned into a Sabbath howre: Loe then, if by deniall of the 7th day, they haue not nullified the 4th co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. or as good as nullified it: for, the Lord was wont to haue an whole day, celebrated for his worſhip by the 4th com. but now, we need giue him but an howre in a day for his worſhip, by the 4th com. thus Sabbath daies, may be turned into Lecture daies; &amp; is not this a manifeſt violence done vnto Gods Law? and thus it muſt be by their denial, vnleſſe they can ſhew vs, that God commanded ij. daies in his 4th com. an old day, &amp; a new day; the 7th day, &amp; the 8th day.</p>
                        <p n="2">2dly, it followeth, that if the 7th day from the Creation be aboliſhed, as they ſay it is, then now a daies, we are not bound by the 4th com. to giue God one day in euery 7 daies for a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; but we may giue God one day in 7, or one day in 14, or one day in a moneth, or one day in a yeere, or one in 7 yeeres, or one in a mans life time: for being that the 7th day in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. is aboliſhed, &amp; none other day there is ſpecified, or put into its roome, we are now left at randome, to take a day when we pleaſe; for the 4th com. doth not tell vs how often we ſhould keepe a Sabbath, ſince thoſe words (the 7th day) are aboliſhed, which teld vs how often we ſhould giue God a Sabbath; now iudge thou good Reader, if they haue not as good as nullified Gods 4th com. by aboliſhing the 7th day, ſince God was wont
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:21140:240"/>to haue a 7th day once a weeke by his 4th com. but now we need not by that com. giue him a Sabbath aboue once in a yeere, or once in 7 yeeres, or once in a mans life: for the time how often, being aboliſhed, there remaineth in the 4th com. no more but the duty, to keepe a Sabbath day; and that we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, if we keepe but one in our whole life.</p>
                        <p>But we haue not yet done: In the 4th co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. there is ij. thinges to be obſerued, the one is the duety of an <hi>Holy Rest,</hi> the other is the duety of an <hi>Holy time,</hi> to wit, the 7th day: now of theſe two things, they hold the time a ceremony and aboliſhed; but the duety of an Holy Reſt, this they hold morall, and this they carefully performe on the Lords day as they perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, well but if now I ſhall proue vnto you, that their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this Holy Reſt vpon a wrong day, is not the Sabbaths duety, nor the duety required by God in his 4th com. then you will ſay with me, that their aboliſhing of the time the 7th day, is the aboliſhing of the 4th com. alſo: for there are but ij. things inyoned in the Com. &amp; they deny the one expreſly, and the other by iuſt conſequence.</p>
                        <p>For this purpoſe note, that the <hi>like</hi> is not the <hi>ſame:</hi> for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, A counterfaite, is like a current ſhilling, yet it is not a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſhilling: Sauls Sacrificing was like to Samuels ſacrificing, but not the ſame: and ſo, the Lords day, Holy Reſt, may be like the Sabbath daies, Holy Reſt, but yet for all that, it is not the Sabbath daies Holy Reſt.</p>
                        <p>It is to be obſerued, that the Lords day Reſt, differeth from the Sabbath daies Reſt three wayes; the firſt is in the name; for the name Reſt, receineth its denomination moſt properlie, from the day wherin it is done; thus the Reſt performed on a Faſt day, is called a Faſt daies reſt; &amp; the Reſt on a common Holie day, is to be called an Holy day reſt, not Sabbath day reſt; the worke done on a Saturday is called Saturdaies worke; and the worke done on a friday, it is called Fridaies worke; and ſo the Reſt performed on the Lords day, it is the Lords day reſt, not the Sabbath day reſt; it is abſurd to miſename things; for if you may call the Reſt, performed on the Lords day, the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath daies reſt; why may you not by the like reaſon, call the
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:21140:240"/>Fridaies worke, Saturdaies worke? and the reſt on a common holy day, the Sabbath day reſt? and a Faſtdaies reſt; or any day of publike thankſgiuings reſt, the Sabbath daies reſt? and why may we not call Sauls ſacrificing, Samuels ſacrificing? the Lords daies Reſt therfore, is not the Sabbath daies Reſt.</p>
                        <p>The other way whereby the Lords day reſt, differeth from the Sabbath daies Reſt, is in reſpect of the 4th Comm. for the reſt performed on the Sabbath day, is properlie the reſt of the 4th Com. becauſe the 4th Com. inioyneth its reſt, to be vpon the Sabbath day; but the reſt performed on the Lords day, cannot be a reſt belonging to the 4th Comm. becauſe the 4th Comm. doth not command any reſt vpon that day which is named Lords day: it commandeth onelie ſuch a reſt as is on the day named Sabbath day, and it commandeth labour &amp; worke on the day called Lords day, it being one of the ſixe working daies.</p>
                        <p>Happily they will ſay, that they performe this reſt on the Lords day, in conſcience to the 4th Com. But I anſwer, that it cannot belong therfore vnto the 4th Com. for it is not mens <hi>conſcience,</hi> but Gods <hi>ordinance</hi> that maketh a reſt to be the reſt of the 4th Com. which I thus declare, if mens keeping a reſt with a reſpect vnto the 4th Com. would therfore make it a reſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the 4th Com. then it ſhall follow, that if any man in his ignorance, will obſerue the reſt on a faſt day, &amp; on a Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation day, in a conſcience of the 4th Com. faineing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that it is commanded in the 4th Com. then it ſhall come to paſſe, that Faſt dayes, &amp; Coronation dayes, ſhall ſtand by virtue of the 4th Com. and be Sabbathes too: further, by this deuiſe, whereas the Iewes had many Sabbaths, ſome weekly, others yeerly; they might haue obſerued their yeerly Sabbaths in conſcience of the 4th Com.</p>
                        <p>The third way whereby the reſt of the Lords day, differeth from the Reſt of the Sabbath day, is in regard of the <hi>ends</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are obſerued: for the Holy reſt of the Sabbath day, is kept to preſerue in Gods Church the memory of the <hi>Creation;</hi> but the Holy reſt of the Lords day, is to preſerue the memory of the <hi>Redemption:</hi> the Sabbath daies reſt, mindeth vs of Gods
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:21140:241"/>reſt vpon the Sabbath day; but the Lords daies reſt, mindeth vs of Chriſts Reſurrection vpon the Lords day.</p>
                        <p>Thus you haue ſene it manifeſted, that the Holy reſt which we now performe on the Lords day, it is not that Holy reſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the 4th Comm. it is onely like vnto it, but it is not the ſame; for it differeth, 1. in the name, the one being properly called the Sabbath daies Reſt; the other, the Lords daies Reſt, 2. It differeth in reſpect of the 4th Com. for the Reſt proper to the 4th Com. is a reſt vpon the 7th day, &amp; vpon a day whoſe name is properly Sabbath day; but our reſt, is vpon the 8th day, &amp; vpon a day whoſe proper name is Lords day. 3. It dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth in the vſe &amp; end; for the Reſt on the Sabbath day, is to preſerue a memory of the Creation; but the reſt on the Lords day, is to preſerue a memory of the Reſurrection or Redemption. 4. I will add a 4th difference which is this, the reſt vpon the Sabbath day, which is commanded in the 4th com. is a reſt, to be obſerued in imitation of Gods Reſt, on the 7th day, at the Creation Geneſ. 2.3. Exod. 20.11. but the Reſt on the Lords day, is not done in imitation of Gods reſt at the Creation; nor can be: for God reſted on the 7th day, &amp; our Lords daies reſt is on the 8th day: now this is farr from imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of God, when he reſted vpon one day, and we will Reſt vpon an other. And thus in theſe four reſpects it is euident, that the Reſt which now we keepe, it is none of Gods Reſt, ordeined in his 4th Comm. it is but like it, as a counterfaite ſhilling, is like a currant ſhilling; let no man therfore any longer deceiue himſelfe, by thinking he keepeth Gods reſt, when he reſteth on the Lords day.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, foraſmuch as the Holy reſt we now keepe on the Lords day, it is not that Holy reſt required in the 4th com. hereby you ſee plainly, that now we neither giue God the time, no nor the dueties of the time; and that by aboliſhing of the ſacred &amp; ſanctified <hi>time</hi> of the 7th day, they haue alſo aboliſhed the <hi>Holy reſt,</hi> required of God in this 4th Com. and thus there being but two things inioyned vs in the 4th Comm. they haue reiected them both; iudge then good Reader, if they haue not by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of the 7th day Sabbath, made voide and nullified alſo
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:21140:241"/>the 4th Commandement: for they obſerue iuſt nothing of all that God commandeth, but haue reiected both the time, &amp; the dueties in the time. And thus much for proofe, that by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the 7th day Sabbath, they haue made voide &amp; nullified the 4th Com. it ſelfe.</p>
                        <p>I come now vnto the reaſon of the 4th Com. to ſhew you how they haue nullified &amp; made voide that alſo; for they haue made moſt horrible hauocke with Gods Commandement, by reiecting the Saturday Sabbath: The body of the 4th Com. is conteined in iij. verſes, Exod. 20.8.9.10. and I haue ſhowne how theſe iij. verſes, of the xx Chapter of Exodus, are made voide and nullified; and now I come to ſhew how they haue made fruſtrate alſo an other whole verſe, to wit, verſe the 11th, and ſo they ſhall haue filled vp the meſure of their iniquity ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, by a ſacrilegiouſe robbing God, of iiij. whole verſes out of his Morall Law, by taking away the key of knowledge from them: for I account it all as one, to rend iiij. verſes of ſacred Scripture out of the <hi>Bible,</hi> &amp; to peruert the ſenſe of them; or to turne the ſenſe &amp; vſe of them, into Ciphers.</p>
                        <p>That I may ſhew you, how by denying and aboliſhing the 7th day Sabbath, they haue nullified &amp; made voide the reaſon of the 4th Com. alſo, firſt I will recite the reaſon, <hi>for in ſixe daies the Lord made the heauen &amp; the earth, the ſea, &amp; all that in them is, and reſted the 7th day: Therfore the Lord bleſſed the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day &amp; hallowed it</hi> Exod. 20.11. This 11th verſe, is a reaſon giuen by Almightie God, thereby to perſwade vnto the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the 4th Com. The Commandement was this, that we ſhould worke vpon thoſe ſixe daies, which were the firſt ſixe daies from the begining of the Creation; &amp; that we ſhould reſt from labour on the 7th day from the Creation: now the reaſon whereby God would perſwade vs herevnto, is a reaſon drawne from his owne example; becauſe that in thoſe ſixe daies, God himſelfe laboured, and in the ſame 7th day, God himſelfe reſted; yea, and therfore hallowed &amp; <hi>ſanctified</hi> this 7th day.</p>
                        <p>Now what reaſon can be more liuly, then a reaſon drawne from Gods example? &amp; what argument can be more moueing, with the ſonnes &amp; daughters of God, then an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fetched
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:21140:242"/>from the example of their heauenly fathers? but let the oldeſt man liuing tell me, if euer he heard any Miniſter in the pulpit, preſſe the keeping of the 4th com. by this <hi>reaſon,</hi> which God hath here added vnto his 4th com, or let any man tell me, if euer he heard the ſanctification of the Lords day, which is the firſt day of the weeke, preſſed by this <hi>reaſon</hi> here added by God vnto his 4th com. Nay, what Miniſter will not be aſhamed, to perſwade men, either to the keeping of the 4th com. or to keeping of the Lords day, by this reaſon, which heere God hath propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? for, we neither worke on thoſe 6 dayes wherin God wrought, neither doe we reſt on that 7th day wherein God reſted: for we reſt on the 8th day, or firſt day, not as God did, on the 7th day; &amp; our Lords day, God did not reſt on it, for our imitation, but he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured on it for our imitation; ſo as there is no <hi>correſpondency</hi> betwixt our Lords day Sabbath, &amp; our now keeping of the 4th com. &amp; Gods example &amp; reaſon propounded vnto vs.</p>
                        <p>When did you euer heare any Miniſter ſay thus, Let vs reſt from our laboures on the Lords day; becauſe God himſelfe, as our Patterne, reſted on the Lords day? and let vs ſanctify &amp; hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the firſt day; becauſe God bleſſed &amp; ſanctified the firſt day? you ſee how God hath added a moſt liuely &amp; effectuall reaſon, to his 4th com. drawne from his owne example, to moue vs to reſt on the Lords day, &amp; to ſanctify the firſt day? tell me, if euer you heard any Miniſter thus preſſe this reaſon, &amp; Gods example: or, if yee haue heard any houer aboute it, as loath to touch it, he hath nicknamed dayes, caling the Lords day, Sabbath day; &amp; the 8th or firſt day, the 7th day: wherefore, becauſe Miniſters cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, how to make Gods example, and <hi>exemplary reaſon,</hi> to fit &amp; ſquare to our new Sabbath, therefore they are mute &amp; ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and thus you ſee the reaſon of the 4th com. ſtandeth in our <hi>Bibles</hi> but for a Cipher; &amp; men are a ſhamed to vſe it, leaſt they ſhould ſhame themſelues: is it not a lamentable thing, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are aſhamed to deliuer the whole will &amp; counſaile of God, leaſt thereby they ſhould both ſhame themſelues, &amp; bewray vnto the people their foule errour in aboliſhing of Gods Sabbaths? for if this reaſon were vſed, men would eaſily ſee, how wide we are from the marke, in keeping the Lords day, in conſcience of the 4th

                        <p>To ſumme vp all, you haue ſeene how they that aboliſh the 7th day Sabbath, they haue turned the body of the 4th com. into a company of Ciphers; &amp; this hath bene declared &amp; proued many wayes: yea they haue alſo turned the <hi>reaſon</hi> to the 4th com. into ſo many words, ſo many Ciphers; for it ſtandeth in the booke of God for a mute, and is like a blanke in a Lottery; no Miniſter vſeing this reaſon of God before his people, to perſwade them to the keeping of the Lords day, or of the Sabbath day, by it: So then ſince they haue not onely nullified the commandement, but alſo made voyde and vſeleſſe, the reaſon annexed to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; hereby you ſee, they haue by reiecting Gods hallowed and ſanctified <hi>time,</hi> the Saturday Sabbath, reiected alſo the whole 4th com. with euery parte and perſell of it, roote and branch.</p>
                        <p>There are not many verſes in the Morall Law, and behold how of thoſe fewe verſes, they haue turned into Ciphers, &amp; made voyde &amp; vſeleſſe, no leſſe then iiij whole verſes. v. 8.9.10.11. there are not aboue 15 or 16 verſes, in all the Morall law; now whoſoeuer reiecteth the Saturday or 7th day Sabbath, you ſee he maketh voyde &amp; fruſtrate, no leſſe then 4 of thoſe verſes: it is an errour, caling for deepeſt conſideration, &amp; a ſpeedy reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                        <p>My 10th Argument, to proue that the 7th day Sabbath men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the law, is ſtill in force: is becauſe our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> ratified the very <hi>least</hi> thing commanded in the Law to endure for euer, Mat. 5.18. &amp; thus it may be framed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>He that ratified the very leaſt thing commanded in the Law, vnto the least letter, to laſt for euer; he ratified the 7th day Sabbath to be ſtill in force.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But Chriſt ratified the very least thing commanded in the Law, vnto the least letter, to last for euer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore Chriſt ratified the 7th day Sabbath to be ſtill in force.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the Major or firſt propoſition, it is cleere of it ſelfe; for nothing therin can be doubted of: for admit that the 7th
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:21140:243"/>day Sabbath, be the leaſt thing commanded in the Morall Law; why then hee that ratified euery thing commanded in the Law, vnto the very <hi>leaſt</hi> thing therein (call it an accident, or a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, or what elſe <hi>diminutily</hi> you will) he did ratifie this litle thing alſo, the 7th day Sabbath: the argument is good <hi>a minori;</hi> for, if <hi>Christ</hi> would not haue a title of a letter in the Law altered, much leſſe an <hi>ordinance</hi> commanded in the Law, as is the 7th day Sabbath.</p>
                        <p>I come next vnto the Minor or ſecond propoſition, and this is moſt cleerly proued by the words of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>For truly I ſay vnto you vntill heauen &amp; earth periſh, one iote, or one title ſhall in no wiſe paſſe from the Law, vntill all things be fulfilled</hi> Mat. 5.18. In which words, our Sauiour Chriſt plainly ratified, the very leaſt things commanded in the Law, to laſt for euer: for as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ſaith vpon this text, <hi>iote,</hi> is a letter of the Hebrew Alphabet of the leaſt value of all other letters in the Alphabet: &amp; <hi>title,</hi> ſaith hee) is as a pricke to a letter, or as a comma to a ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: whereby we ſee, that inaſmuch as Chriſt, would not haue one of the leaſt letters of the Law, no nor ſo much a title of a letter, as a pricke is vpon the letter (i) in no wiſe to departe from the Law, hereby he ratified the very leaſt thing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Law: that Chriſt ratified the Law, vnto a <hi>iot</hi> and <hi>title,</hi> extendeth to the very leaſt things in the Law, more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically, &amp; more voide of exception, then if he had ſaid, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall paſſe from the Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(Had the 7th day Sabbath bene to be aboliſhed a while after, Chriſt ſhould haue forknowne it well enough; &amp; then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that, he would neuer haue here ratified the Law ſo vniuerſally vnto a very iot and title of it)</p>
                        <p>This is plaine, if we looke but vpon the very next verſe verſ. 19. <hi>Whoſoeuer therefore ſhall breake one of theſe leaſt commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and teach men ſo, he ſhall be caled the least in the Kingdome of heauen,</hi> Mat. 5.19. So here then in plaine words you ſee our Sauiour ratifieth the very <hi>leaſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement:</hi> yet further, Chriſt intended to ratify not onely the leaſt comman. but alſo the leaſt <hi>branch</hi> of euery commandement: for he ratified not onely the 6th com. touching murther but alſo the leaſt thing therin
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:21140:243"/>conteined, as raſh anger, and caling an other foole v. 22. &amp; the 7th com. hee ratified it to the leaſt iot &amp; title of it, euen to the adultery of the heart, and to a luſtfull looke v. 28. &amp; the ſeconp Table, of loue, Chriſt ratified it to the vtmoſt, extending it, euen to the loue of our enemies v. 44. by all which it is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that our bleſſed Sauiour, intended, to ratify this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Law of his heauenly father, to the very vtmoſt, &amp; vnto the very leaſt thing therin commanded, neither can any man (I think) invent, ſhould he ſtudy 7 yeeres for it, how to expreſſe himſelfe in words more vniuerſally &amp; emphatically, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize euery thing, vnto the very leaſt of all, ſo as his words ſhould be liable to no exceptions, then our Sauiour Chriſt hath expreſſed himſelfe heere: ſo emphatically, ſo vniuerſally, and ſo full are his words heere ſpoken to that end.</p>
                        <p>Thus you haue ſene this argument firmly proued, neither can I deuiſe, what ſhould be more plaine &amp; pregnant, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this ordinance of Gods morall Sabbath, then this text vttered by our Sauiour Chriſt: but by how much it is the clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, by ſo much the more, Sathan ſtirreth vp oppoſition againſtit; let vs therefore ſee what trickes and quillets the wit of man can deuiſe againſt it; that ſo all rubbs being remoued, our faith may reſt vpon this rocke of Chriſts word, the more firmly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curly.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. One anſwer brought againſt this argument is this, that by the word <hi>Law</hi> may be vnderſtod, both the morall and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Lawes. But this is an vnwarrantable enlargment of the word law: for it is a rule, that generall words, muſt be reſtrained vnto the Subiect matter in hand; as in Heb. 7.12. if by the word Law there, we ſhould vnderſtand both morall and ceremoniall Lawes, we ſhould make foule worke; wherefore as the word Law in Heb. 7.12. is to be raſtained vnto the Leuiticall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law, according to the matter there ſpoken of; ſo muſt we by the word Law in Mat. 5.18. vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d onely the morall Law, according to the matter here ſpoken of: for as you may ſe plainly by the context, our Sauior ſpeaketh of the morall Law, for our Sauiour hauing ratified the Law in generall in v. 18.19. then he deſcendeth vnto particulars, giuinge examples in the 6th com.
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:21140:244"/>touching murther, as in v. 21. &amp; in the 7th com. touching adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, as in v. 27. &amp; in the third com. touching ſwearing, as in v. 3. &amp; the latter parte of the Chapter, is ſpent in dueties of loue towards our neighbour, conteined in the ſecond Table, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſee our Sauiour ſpake onely of the morall Law.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I proue that the ceremoniall Law cannot be here meante; for, Chriſt ſaid but in the verſe a forgoing, that he came not to deſtroy the (<hi>Law</hi> or the Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>phets) which phraſe, our <hi>Saniour</hi> vſeth in this Sermon, for the Morall Law onely Mat. 7.12. and neuer other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, Mat. 22.40. ſecondly, then ſhould Chriſt haue ratified the ceremoniall Law, vnto the worlds end, in Mat. 5.18. which is contrary vnto all Scriptures: and therfore Chriſt ſpake nothing of the ceremoniall Law in this place. 3. Since Chriſt ſpake here, of the duration &amp; continuance of the Law, for euer; it is abſurd to thinke, that in this caſe, he would ioyne the Morall and the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Laws together, as if they were both of a like perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity &amp; laſting nature: and therfore onelie the Morall Law was here meante. 4. Can it be thought that Chriſt ſhould make here in v. 17. an Apologie for the Ceremoniall Law, when elſwhere he preached againſt it? Ioh. 4.21. Beſids ſince Chriſt intended a little after, to aboliſh the Ceremoniall Law, he would rather haue bene ſilent now, then to ſay ought that might ratifye it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. An other anſwer made againſt this argument is, that the duration of the Law here ſpoken of by Chriſt, is but vntill Chriſt his <hi>paſſion;</hi> noted in thoſe words, <hi>vntill all things be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi> v. 18. for at Chriſt his paſſion all things were fulfilled. But this anſwer is very abſurd; for theſe words of Chriſt, are a prophecy of the continuance of the Law; which prophecy was ratified by a greate Aſſeueration, ſaying, <hi>verily,</hi> or truly I ſay vnto you &amp;c. Now the time when Chriſt made this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, it was not aboue a matter of two yeeres before his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or there about; now who could thinke, that Chriſt ſhould make a prophecy, &amp; that in ſuch ſolemne a maner, with ſuch an Aſſeueration, that the Law ſhould laſt, &amp; continue yet, two yeers longer? Further, if this anſwer &amp; expoſition be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then by the ſame anſwer may we now reiect, a greate parte of Chriſts ſermon in the mount, &amp; eſpecially his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:21140:244"/>vpon the Morall Law; for whereas, our Sauiour ratifieth the very leaſt of the commandements in v. 19. &amp; expoundeth the 6th Com. to forbid raſh anger, &amp; calleing a mans brother foole, v. 22. and expoundeth the 7th Com. to forbid a luſtfull looke, ver. 28. and the 3d Com. to forbid ſwearing by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, v. 34.36. and the 2d table, to command loue to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies v. 44. a man may at once cut off all theſe, from binding vs; if he will but ſuppoſe, that theſe enlargments of the Law. being ſo ſtrict &amp; rigorouſe were Iewiſh, and pertaine not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſtians; &amp; for the better auoiding of them, he may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that Chriſt ratified the Law, thus expounded, but vntill his death &amp; <hi>paſsion,</hi> were not this a goodly anſwer?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is falſe which they ſay, that all things were fulfilled at Chriſt his paſſion: It is true indeed, that Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, ſaid, <hi>it is finiſhed,</hi> Ioh. 19.30. that is, his death &amp; paſſion was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but yet <hi>all</hi> things were not finiſhed; for the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was behind. Wherefore the truer ſenſe, is by theſe words (till all things be fulfilled) to vnderſtand, euen all things, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer Chriſt was to doe for his Church; and all things, which were any way prophecied of him, or of his Church militant: as this for one, Chriſt <hi>tarrieth</hi> now at the right hand of God, vntill his enemies be made his footeſtoole, Hebr. 10.12.13. This one thing, is not yet fulfilled: ſee 1 Cor. 15.25. an other thing is, that the heauens muſt containe Chriſt, vntill the time that all things be reſtored, Act. 3.21. this other thing is not yet fulfilled, to wit, Chriſt his ſecond comeing, and the reſtauration of all things. A third thing is, that the Church ſhall ſing A trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant ſong, ouer <hi>death,</hi> the <hi>graue,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſinne,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.55.56. &amp; this thing is not yet fulfilled neither: now ſince all theſe things, ſhall not be fulfilled, vntill the worlds end, therfore the Law is to laſt vnto the worlds end; for it muſt laſt, vntill all things be fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>Yet further, the ſame is euident and apparent in the Text it ſelfe; for our Sauiour ſaith, that the Law ſhall laſt <hi>vntill heauen &amp; earth periſh, or paſse away:</hi> that is, vntill the end of the world: for then ſhall the heauens, &amp; the earth paſſe away, and be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, as ſaith S. Peter, <hi>the heauens ſhall paſſe away with a noiſe, &amp; the elements ſhall melt with heate, and the earth with the workes that

Pet. 3.10. ſo long therfore as the heauens &amp; the earth laſt, ſo long ſhall the Law, &amp; euery iot, and title of it laſt: the ſame is ratifyed by S. Luk, ſaying, <hi>It is more eaſy that heauen &amp; earth ſhould paſſe away, then that one title of the Law ſhould fall,</hi> Luk. 16.17.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, ſuppoſe we that in this text, there were no Prophecy at all, touching the duration &amp; continuance of the Law, yet foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we imbrace this <hi>Sermon,</hi> which Chriſt preached vpon the <hi>Mount,</hi> as concerning vs &amp; our times; we muſt therefore imbrace this parte of his Sermon, wherein he preached and taught, that the Law, with the leaſt commandement thereof, yea &amp; euery branch of this Law, vnto a iot &amp; title, muſt goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for, Chriſt did not onely preſſe the Law vpon his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but alſo euery title of it: wherefore by the ſame right that we imbrace the other partes &amp; paſſages of Chriſts Sermon, by the ſame right we muſt imbrace alſo the Law, &amp; euery iot and title of the Law: this Diuine Sermon of Chriſt, it is iij Chapters long, it begane Mat. 5.1.4. It laſted vnto Mat. 8.1. If you may reiect ſome partes of this Sermon, as not belonging vnto vs, then may you reiect all the Sermon; &amp; if you imbrace ſome partes, then muſt you imbrace all: &amp; thus you ſee, their anſwer is vaine, in goeing about to confine the duration of the Law, vnto the time of Chriſts liuing vpon the earth, or vnto his death and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion onely.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A third anſwer is, that not euery iot &amp; title of the Law is now in force; for there be ſome things in the Law, that be not in force, as in the preface to the commandements; I am the Lord thy God, <hi>that brought the out of the Land of Egypt:</hi> this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance out of Egypt, belongeth not vnto vs Chriſtians; for we neuer were in bondagein Egypt: &amp; alſo the reaſon annexed vnto the 5th com. <hi>that thy dayes may be longe in the Land which the Lord thy God giueth thee:</hi> this Land was <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp; therefore the promiſe of this Land, cannot belong vnto vs Chriſtians. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I anſwer, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth apply this promiſe vnto <hi>Christianes,</hi> that liued not in <hi>Canaan,</hi> as you may reade Eph. 6.1.2.3. neither doth the Lord ſay, that thy dayes may be long in the Land of Canaan: but generally thus, that thy dayes may be
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:21140:245"/>long in the Land, which God ſhall giue thee, that is, any Land, into which God ſhould bring them: wherefore the promiſe to the 5th com. is not to be reſtrained vnto Canaan onely, but may belong vnto any Land. And as for the preface touching the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance out of Egypt, this belongeth to this day, vnto thoſe people vnto whome it did at any time belong, that is vnto the Iſraelites</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, I giue one anſwer ſeruing vnto both theſe, which is this, admit that there be ſome titles of the Law, that doe not belong vnto vs, as theſe two reaſones annexed to the Law, yet they cannot ſhew any titles of the Law, that doe not belong vnto vs, which are partes of the Law: for we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt the <hi>law,</hi> &amp; the <hi>appurtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces</hi> belonging to the law: the law, is that parte of the Decalogue, which command. or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth ſomething; the appurtenances of this Law, are the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Law; &amp; the motiues or reaſones to perſwade to the obedience of this Law; &amp; theſe are not deliuered in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or forbiddeing termes: now I ſtand to defend by my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nothing more in the Law, then what is Law, &amp; expreſly commanded or forbidden: neither doe I expound Chriſts words Mat. 5.18. Any larger then ſo; howbeit Iiudge, that Chriſt his words ought to be extended, not onely vnto the Law, but alſo to the appurtenances of the Law, if poſſiblie they may, &amp; where neceſſity &amp; abſurdety doe not hinder. To conclud, ſince my argument ſpeaketh onely of ſuch iotes in the Law, as are Law, &amp; deliuered in commanding or forbidding termes, their obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is impertinent &amp; beſids the matter in queſtion, to bring ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptiones of ſuch iotes as are no law, nor parte of Law, bur onely appendixes to the Law: for all the appurtenances belonging to the Law, might poſſiblie be of no force, &amp; yet the law it ſelfe may ſtand ſafely ſtill; like as a mans apparell may be worne out, or burned, &amp; yet his body may be ſafe ſtill.</p>
                        <p>For a concluſion, let me add one thing in generall, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth againſt all their 3 anſwers, which is this, All Orthodox and ſound Diuines, when they haue to deale againſt the enemies, of Gods law, who would aboliſh the whole law, as <hi>Libertines, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi> &amp; our new vpſtart <hi>Eatoniſts,</hi> they doe defend Gods law
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:21140:246"/>to be Morall &amp; perpetuall by this text for one Math. 5.18. Nay I know not any text we haue in all the new Teſtament, that is more auailable for this purpoſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this one text: but if now our <hi>diuines,</hi> will ſtand to defend theſe 4 anſweres, which I haue confuted, then why may not any of theſe Libertines or the reſt, make the ſame anſwers to them, when they produce this Text, Mat. 5.18. to defend the perpetuity of Gods Law? as firſt, why may not theſe Libertines anſwer, ſaying, by the word <hi>Law,</hi> in Mat. 5.18. may be meant both the Morall &amp; the Ceremoniall Laws; and ſo Chriſt ſhould ratify the Morall Law no more then he did the Ceremoniall Law? 2. And why may they not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer alſo, that the duration of the Law here ſpoken of by Chriſt, is but vntill Chriſts paſſion? 3. And why may they not anſwer you alſo, that there are ſome iotes &amp; things in the Law, that belong not vnto vs Chriſtianes? as in the preface to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, Gods deliuerance of the Iſraelites out of Egypt: And the reaſon to the 5th com. that thy daies may be long in the Land that the Lord thy God giueth thee, that is, in the Land of Canaan? that ſo you ſhall not from this text, defend all and euery of the tenn commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Wherefore, either they muſt withdrawe &amp; renounce theſe 3 anſwers made to mee, or elſe they muſt receiue them at the hands of Libertines, Anabaptiſts, &amp; Antinomians.</p>
                        <p>Thus much for my 10th Argument, whereby I haue proued, that our Sauiour Chriſt ratified the 7th day Sabbath, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in the Morall Law: becauſe hee ratified the very leaſt things commanded in the Morall Law.</p>

                        <p> 
                           <hi>But Christ, commanded his Diſciples, to vſe all poſſible meanes, that they might not profane the Sabbath day, by working, crauailing, moiling &amp; toiling on it, for about 50 yeeres after the death and end of all Coremonies.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>For the Major or firſt propoſition, two things are there in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, as for the former, it is a moſt cleere caſe: for he that would not haue the Sabbath day profaned, he would haue it ſanctified and obſerued: like as in the 7th com. in that God would not haue a man commit adultery, it followeth that God would haue him liue chaſtly: the remouing of one contrary is the bringing in of the other: the forbidding of a ſinne, is the commanding of its contrary virtue.</p>
                        <p>And further, he that willeth all poſſible meanes to be vſed, for the auoiding of any euill, he would that that euill ſhould be auoided, &amp; the contrary good brought in: &amp; ſo, he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all poſſible meanes to be vſed, that the Sabbath day might not be profaned, he would not haue the Sabbath day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned; but that the contrary good ſhould be brought in, which is, that the Sabbath day ſhould be ſanctified: for to that very end, that it might not be profaned but ſanctified, he appointed the meanes to be vſed; now no man commandeth meanes to be vſed, for the obtaining of that thing, which he would not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
                        <p>The other thing conſiderable is, that he that willed the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day ſhould be ſanctified and kept from profanation, 50 yeeres after the death of all Ceremonies, he willed that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day ſhould be ſtill in force vnto this day: the reaſon hereof is, becauſe there was but one proper time, for the aboliſhing of all ceremonies; &amp; all ceremonies they were aboliſhed together at once; &amp; therefore whatſoeuer was ratified &amp; to be obſerued 40 or 50 yeeres, after the proper time for the death &amp; end of all ceremonies, that thing was no ceremony; for if it were, it ſhould not haue ſuruiued all ceremonies: neither was it aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ceremonies as a ceremony; for then no care ſhoul haue bene vſed ſo long after, for its obſeruation: now if it was not
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:21140:247"/>a boliſhed with ceremonies, at the proper time when all cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were aboliſhed, then was it no ceremony but a Morall, &amp; conſequently to laſt perpetually.</p>
                        <p>I grant that many ceremonies were in vſe in the Church, long after they were aboliſhed, but it was by <hi>connivency</hi> and by ſufferance onely, &amp; for the weakeneſſe of thoſe times, but neuer by the <hi>authority</hi> of the Lord of them, as this is: for, the Sabbath day, it was not by <hi>conniuency,</hi> for Chriſt commanding his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to <hi>pray</hi> againſt the profanation of the Sabbath day; doth thereby <hi>warrant</hi> the ſanctification of it.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, whatſoeuer was authorized to be vſed in the Church, 40 or 50 yeeres after Chriſt his death, that is ſtill to be retained &amp; vſed in the Church; for all things which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did either erect or continue in the Church for 10.20.30. or 40 yeeres after Chriſt his Paſſion, not as conniued at, but as authorized &amp; as a duety, thoſe things are ſtill in force in the Church; no inſtance can be ſhowne to the contrary. And ſo much for proofe of the Major.</p>
                        <p>I come now vnto the Minor or ſecond propoſition, &amp; this I proue out of Mat. 24.20. <hi>But pray that your flight be not in the Winter, neither on the Sabbath day.</hi> Which wordes of our Sauiour doe fully proue my Minor: for 1. theſe words are a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of Chriſts, in that he biddeth them pray; <hi>But pray &amp;c.</hi> 2. This commandement it was directed vnto his Diſciples, as you may ſee Mat. 24.1.2. 3dly This commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was, that they ſhould vſe all poſſible meanes, to auoid their flight vpon the Sabbath day: for there was none other meanes to be vſed for the auoiding of this flight, but onely <hi>prayers</hi> to God; for their ſtudy &amp; care, and other humane &amp; naturall meanes, could doe nothing in this matter, for the Preuention of this flight, ſo then prayer being all the meanes that poſſiblie could be vſed, Chriſt commanded his Diſciples to vſe all meanes that was poſſible to be vſed: yea, ſince prayer muſt be accompanied with all meanes &amp; indeauores of man, if more meanes could haue bene vſed, Chriſt would haue had more vſed. 4. This meanes of prayer to God, which Chriſt commanded them to vſe, was to this end, that they might not profane the Sabbath day: for ſo ſaith the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:21140:247"/>text, <hi>pray that your flight be not on the Sabbath day:</hi> Whereby you ſee, that our Sauiour would not haue them profane the Sabbath day, by their flight vpon it: for the further cleering of this point, becauſe it is of the greateſt conſequence; I will proue vnto you, that when our Sauiour bad them pray againſt flying on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, hee ſpake it becauſe he would not haue them profane the Sabbath day by that their flight.</p>
                        <p>For this purpoſe note, that it is the common opinion of expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiters vpon this text, that when Chriſt ſpake of flight vpon the Sabbath day, he ſpake of it in a religiouſe reſpect: &amp; this may be yet further confirmed vnto vs, if we conſider the <hi>Author</hi> of theſe words, who was <hi>Chriſt;</hi> who was a Phiſitian for the ſoule, &amp; all his Doctrine tended to the furtherance of the kingdome of God; wherefore all his ſpeeches are if poſſible, to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtod as concerning the ſoule, &amp; the kingdome of God; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he mentioneth matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> as is the Sabbath day, then we cannot but thinke he ſpake of it in relation to the ſoule, and to the 4th commandement for the furtherance of the kingdome of God, &amp; the obſeruation of the will of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, ſhewing what conſcience men ought to make of doeing Gods will, &amp; keeping of his Sabbaths: yea, the text gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth light herein: for why ſhould they pray not to flye in the <hi>Winter,</hi> but becauſe of diſcomodety of flight then, by foulneſſe &amp; couldneſſe of weather &amp;c? So, why not on the <hi>Sabbath day;</hi> but becauſe of incommodiouſe trauailing then, by reaſon of the 4th com. and mens conſciences, which is a religiouſe reſpect? Nay how can it enter into any mans head to thinke, that Chriſt ſhould command them to pray, that they might not flie on the Sabbath day, in any other ſenſe then this, becauſe he would not haue them profane it, and becauſe he would haue the will of his heauenly father reuealed in the 4th com. carefully obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; obeied; and becauſe he would not haue thoſe, his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, pollute their conſciences, with profanation of Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath?</p>
                        <p>For the yet further cleering of this point, let it be noted 1. what is compriſed in this word <hi>flight:</hi> ſuppoſe Chriſt had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teld them, that ouer a few yeeres, ſuch an houſe ſhould be on
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:21140:248"/>fyer, in one of the ſeauen dayes; and had alſo bidden them pray, that they might not be put to quench the fyer on the Sabbath day; what could this imply, but that Chriſt would not haue them worke, labour, moyle &amp; toile ſo on the Sabbath day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo it is here, for this end conſider, that this is ſuch a flight, as is made out of a citty by the inhabitantes, when the enemies haue beſeiged it with ſouldiers, as you may ſee Luk. 21.20.21. Now when the beſeiged &amp; diſtreſſed Cittizens, flie out from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their enemies, they vſually carry out with them what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer things of worth they haue in the citty, euen as much as poſſible they can, as their young infantes and children, their beſt apparell, and other things of price; euery man carries forth, euen as much as his backe can beare with his ſafety, ſo that they goe laden out: beſids, they doe not walke at eaſe, as men doe on the Sabbath day for recreation, but they flie and trauaile with all poſſible labour and ſpeede; ſo as the day of their flight, it was a day of moyleing and exceeding toyleinge: I need not mention the diſquiet and diſtraction of the mind, their careing how to ſaue their owne liues, and the liues of their wiues and children, &amp; how to ſaue their goods; all which diſinabled them for, and were enemies to the ſacred dueties of the Sabbath and the worſhip of God therein: all this neglect and putting by of the ſacred dueties of prayer, reading, heareing, conference &amp;c. doth neceſſarily follow the labour of the body by flying on the Sabbath day: Thus much is compriſed in the word <hi>flight;</hi> ſo that, when our Sauiour bid them pray againſt flight on the Sabbath day, it is all one, as if he had bidden them pray, that they might not be driuen to carry burdens on the Sabbath day; and that they might not be put to laboriouſe and painfull trauailes on the Sabbath day. 2. Let it be noted, that to beare burdens, and to trauaile on the Sabbath day, were euer accounted for brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the 4th com. and for profanation of the Sabbath day, as you may read plainly in Nehem. 13.15.17. For Nehemiah re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued the Rulers for bearing of <hi>burdens</hi> on the Sabbath day, ſaying, what euill is this that yee doe, <hi>&amp; profane,</hi> the Sabbath day? ſee alſo Ioh. 5.10. Exod. 16.29. VVhereby you ſee it moſt apparent, that when Chriſt bad them pray againſt flight on the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:21140:248"/>Sabbath day, he meante it, that they ſhould pray againſt profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Sabbath day: for theſe ij are both one, to flie, carry-burdens on the Sabbath day; &amp; to profane the Sabbath, as you ſee by Nehemiahs words: and what doth the word Prophane ſignify, but to make a thing common? &amp; what doe they elſe by flight on the Sabbath, but make it a common day, to wit, a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing &amp; a labouring day? The will of Chriſt doubtleſſe was none other, then the will of God in the 4th com. that is, that his Diſciples ſhould be carefull, to keepe an holy Reſt on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, &amp; to refraine all ſeruile laboures, according as it is in the 4th com. <hi>In it thou ſhalt not doe any worke &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But here I muſt take away a maine obiection; they will be ready to ſay, that it is no profanation of the Sabbath day, to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile on it in a caſe of neceſſity, and to flie to ſaue a mans life, as they doe who are beſeiged &amp;c. Herevnto I anſwer, yis, it is a prophanation of the Sabbath: for what is it to prophane an Holy thing, but to conuert it vnto common vſe? &amp; be it men trauaile to ſaue their liues, yet ſince trauailing &amp; labouring are common workes; by trauailing and labouring on the Sabbath day, as they doe on common daies, they make the Sabbath day a common day, and ſo prophane it: neither will it follow, that becauſe it is no ſinne to trauaile on the Sabbath in a caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, therefore it is no prophanation of the Sabbath: for God hath permitted vs to prophane &amp; make common the Sabbath in a caſe of neceſſity, and ſo prophanation of it is no ſinne as otherwiſe it would haue bene; the prophanation remaines ſtill, but it is no ſinfull prophanation. 2. The conſideration of this obiection doth ſtrengthen my argument: for, if our Sauiour would not haue men to flie &amp; trauaile &amp; worke on the Sabbath day, no not to ſaue their liues, if poſſibly by means of prayer they might auoid it, much leſſe would he haue men doe any worke on the Sabbath, when there is no neceſſity, and in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caſe: it is a ſigne, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was maruailouſly <hi>zealouſe</hi> of his fathers Sabbaths, to haue them religiouſly &amp; carefully ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified after his death, when he would not haue his Diſciples to doe, no not ſuch neceſſary works as might ſaue their liues, on the Sabbath, if they might be preuented: &amp; thus I haue ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proued the 4th thing in my Minor.</p>
                        <pb n="462" facs="tcp:21140:249"/>
                        <p> The 5th and laſt thing, to be proued in my Minor is, that this flight on the Sabbath day, was ſpoken of to be, aboute 50, yeeres after the death &amp; end of all Ceremonies: that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Ieruſalem by <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſpaſian</hi> was a matter of 40, or 46. yeeres after Chriſt his paſſion it is confeſſed by all: &amp; that this obſeruation of the Sabbath, was to be 40, 46, or neere 50 yeeres after the death of all ceremonies, is proued by this, that all ceremonies ended with Chriſt, vpon the Chroſſe, as you may reade, Epheſ. 2.15. Coloſ. 2.14. Now the Sabbath day, being to be obſerued by an holy Reſt, at the deſtruction of Ieruſalem by <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> which was neere 50 yeeres after Chriſts paſſion, at which time all Ceremonies ended, it followeth that the Sabbath was to be obſerued neere 50 yeeres after the end of all Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and thus I haue proued and confirmed, both propoſitiones in my argument.</p>
                        <p>Yet I cale to mind iij obiections more that may be made againſt this argument; the one is, that Chriſt had not reſpect ſo much vnto the Religion &amp; conſcience of the Sabbath, as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to this, that he had a care to the ſafeguard of the liues of thoſe beſeiged: for if they ſhould flie in the winter, they ſhould be hindered by the foulneſſe of the waies; and if on the Sabbath day, they ſhould be hindered by their ſuperſtitiouſe &amp; needleſſe conſcience, which they would make of the Sabbath, &amp; ſo it might come to paſſe, that their enemies ſhould ſurpriſe them becauſe they could not make that ſpeede that was fiting in ſuch a time of danger. Herevnto Ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer, 1. It is agroſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt of any, to account that obedience ſuperſtitiouſe &amp; needleſſe, which was done according to the preſcript of a Morall Commandement, to wit, the 4th com. ſeeing they cannot proue the old Sabbath mentioned in the 4th com. to be aboliſhed. 2. I haue before ſhowne, that Chriſt when he ſpak of ſlight on the Sabbath, he ſpake it in a religiouſe reſpect: but admit that Chriſt ſpake theſe words for the ſafeguard of their liues, yet ſo it will come to the ſame ſtill, that Chriſt ratified the Sabbath day: for, as in the winter, the deepeneſſe of the waies, the ſhortneſſe of the daies, &amp; tediouſneſſe of the weather, would aggrauate theire croſſe, &amp; hinder their ſpeedy flight; ſo on the Sabbath day, the greate
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:21140:249"/>ſorrow of heart that would ſeaze vpon them, for that they were vrged to moile &amp; toile &amp; worke ſo hard vpon that day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were wont ſweetly to Reſt with the people of God, &amp; to praiſe God in the aſſemblie of the Saintes, &amp; for that they were inforced to profane the Sabbath, which they would gladly haue ſanctified in obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Gods 4th com. theſe things would aggrauate the croſſe, and ſticke ſo in their minds as it would make their heartes to faile them, and ſo hinder their ſpeedie flight: thus the winter would be an impediment to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the Sabbath would be an impediment to their ſoules, &amp; ſo the whole man, would be diſabled for a ſpeedy flight, and for the ſafeguard of their liues.</p>
                        <p>Further more as touching their ſuperſtitiouſe conſcience: what reaſon can be imagined, that it ſhould be more vnfit to flie on the Sabbath day, then on a weeke day, or why ſhould their ſpeedy flight be more hindered on the Sabbath day, then on an other day, if not for this cauſe, that they made a conſcience of flying &amp; trauailing on the Sabbath day, more then on any other day? now foraſmuch as our Sauiour commanded them, to pray to God, that they might not fly on that day, <hi>for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their conſciences,</hi> thereby he allowed of, &amp; approued of their making conſcience of the Sabbath day: ſuppoſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt had commanded <hi>Agur,</hi> Prov. 30.8.9. to pray that he might not haue too much, leaſt he ſhould grow proud and hauty, nor too little, leaſt he ſhould ſteale: he ſhould thereby approue of <hi>Agurs</hi> feares of growing prowd, &amp; of ſtealing: &amp; ſo it is in our caſe, for in that Chriſt bad them pray, that they might not flie on the Sabbath day, leaſt thereby their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould be offended &amp; their hearts filled with ſorrow for profaning Gods Sabbath; thereby Chriſt allowed of their conſcience of the Sabbath day, &amp; of their ſorrow for profaning it: and ſo it was no ſuperſtitiouſe conſcience: had the Sabbath day bene aboliſhed long before this ſeige, as this obiection ſuppoſeth, &amp; ſo the conſcience of Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples bene but ſuperſtitiouſe, then would Chriſt neuer haue commanded them to <hi>pray</hi> to God in this caſe? for this were to giue gold for droſſe, &amp; to ſpend Subſtance for ſhaddowes;
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:21140:250"/>would Chriſt think you haue bidden them ſpend Diuine prayers, for the ſatisfying the deſires of a ſuperſtitiouſe &amp; need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe conſcience? &amp; had not this bene an abuſe of holy prayer, and of the Maieſtie of God, to begg of him things for their luſt &amp; vaine deſires? If their conſcience were a vaine &amp; needleſſe conſcience, then they ſhould pray to God to fulfill the deſires of a vaine &amp; needleſſe conſcience, and Chriſt ſhould inſtruct them ſo to doe too, which is moſt abſurd.</p>
                        <p>Had the conſcience of Chriſts Diſciples, bene ſuperſtitiouſe touching the Sabbath day, then would Chriſt haue <hi>reproued</hi> them for it, and rather haue <hi>rectified</hi> their iudgements; &amp; taught them now before hand, that as touching the Sabbath, if it fell out that they muſt flie on the Sabbath day, they ſhould then take no care for that, for he came to aboliſh that amongſt other things, and it ſhould be nullified long before their flight, ſo as that ſhould be no let vnto their flight; thus would Chriſt haue prepared them beforehand, and ſtreng thened them againſt this ſuperſtition, if it had bene ſuperſtition: nay had it bene ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Chriſt had nuſled them vp, &amp; flattered them in it, when he bad them pray to God, that their ſuperſtitiouſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences might not be croſſed or diſquieted; therefore it was no ſuperſtitiouſe but a iuſtifiable &amp; religiouſe conſcience which they made of the Sabbath day: and this is yet the more ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, by conſideration of the perſones that ſhould make this conſcience of the Sabbath, they were Chriſts owne Diſciples, of his owne teaching; and can we thinke, he would leaue them in ſuperſtition, at this time, and in this caſe, when it was ſo needfull that they ſhould be inſtructed therein?</p>
                        <p>Happily it will be ſaid, they were not fit to heare now of the aboliſhing of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> it being a thing ſo highly honoured amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them &amp;c. but why I pray, were they not as able to heare of the aboliſhing of the Sabbath, as to beare of the deſtruction of the <hi>Temple?</hi> for they had the Temple in honour, no leſſe then the Sabbath.</p>
                        <p>Yet further, it appeareth by the context, that their conſcience was not a fained &amp; ſuperſtitiouſe conſcience, but a true &amp; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſe conſcience: for the other things whereof Chriſt admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:21140:250"/>them, are not fained things, but true and reall things; as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid, <hi>woe ſhall be to them which are with child, &amp; which giue ſucke</hi> v. 19. This was no fained thing, for it was a true euill, for women to be put to flie when greate with child, or with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſucking on them: againe, to flie in the <hi>winter,</hi> v. 20. it was no ſuperſtitiouſe conceipt in Chriſts Diſciples, to thinke the winter a very vnſeaſonable time to flie in, but it was ſo indeed, &amp; ſo we are to thinke ſemblably, of their conſcience of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, that it was no needleſſe &amp; ſuperſtitiouſe conceipt in them to thinke it an offence vnto God, a breach of the 4th com. &amp; a grieuouſe matter to trauaile on the Sabbath day, at what time they ſhould be ſeruing and worſhiping of God: and thus much for this obiection.</p>
                        <p>The 2d obiection is this, that by the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the text, may be meant not the 7th day and weekly Sabbath, but ſome one of their yeerly Sabbaths: &amp; ſo then if Chriſt had ratified any thing in this text, it had not beene the 7th day Sabbath, but a ceremoniall Sabbath &amp;c. and the rather they thinke thus, becauſe it is thought that when the Iewes fled out of Ieruſalem, it was not vpon the 7th day Sabbath, but vpon a Feſtiuall Sabbath. But herevnto I reply, 1. That it was no yeerly Sabbath whereof Chriſt ſpake: for, the yeerly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths being all Ceremonies, and to be aboliſhed long before that ſeige of Ieruſalem, if Chriſts Diſciples had made conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of thoſe, then their conſciences had bene ſuperſtitiouſe, But their conſcience was not ſuperſtitiouſe, as hath bene ſhowne; &amp; therefore the Sabbath whereof Chriſt ſpake and they made conſcience, it was no yeerly &amp; ceremoniall Sabbath, but the 7th day and weekly Sabbath. 2. The word Sabbath, when in Scripture it is put abſolutly, without any addition, &amp; when the context giueth no light to the contrary, it is to be vnderſtod of the 7th day &amp; weekly Sabbath: for this was the moſt frequent &amp; ordenary Sabbath, &amp; Chriſts his ſpeeches are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtod in an ordenary &amp; not in an extraordinary ſenſe, and of thoſe things which were vſuall, rather then of thoſe which were rare &amp; ſeldome.</p>
                        <p>As for their reaſon, that it is thought they fled vpon a yeerly Sabbath day, &amp; not vpon the weekly Sabbath day, this proueth
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:21140:251"/>not, that therefore their conſcience was not of the weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; but rather, that their conſcience was of the weekly Sabbath day: for, inaſmuch as Chriſt commanded his Diſciples, to pray that they might not flie vpon a Sabbath day, it is to be beleeued, that they did pray accordingly; &amp; further it is to be beleeued, that ſince they prayed at Chriſts commandement, and being Chriſts Diſciples, that they prayed in faith: and that therefore they obtained their prayer: whence it may be collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they prayed againſt flight on the weekly 7th day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; becauſe they did not flie on the weekly 7th day Sabbath; for God heard their prayer. But to thinke they made conſcience of a yeerly ceremoniall Sabbath, &amp; prayed againſt it, and yet were driuen to flie on it, is abſurdly to ſuppoſe, that God croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their prayers, and denied their petition. And thus much for the 2d obiection.</p>
                        <p>The laſt obiection or rather anſwer is, that by the name <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day</hi> Chriſt might vnderſtand the <hi>Lords day.</hi> But why may they not as well ſay, when Chriſt ſpake of <hi>Winter,</hi> he meant the <hi>Sommer?</hi> and when in the new Teſtament there is mention of Circumciſion, therby may Baptiſme be meant? where did they euer read the Lords day named Sabbath day in Scripture? ſuer I am, the holy Ghoſt putteth a plaine difference betwixt the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, &amp; the Lords day, or firſt day of the weeke, ſee Mark. 16.1.2. Finally, who that conſidereth how Chriſt &amp; his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, made the Lords day a trauailing day Luk. 24.13. Could thinke, that Chriſt would not permit his Diſciples 50 yeers after, to trauaile on the Lords day, to ſaue their liues, if by this Sabbath day, he meant the Lords day? &amp; thus much for my elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth argument, which ſtandeth good againſt all their obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones and gaineſayings.</p>

                        <p>My Twelueth &amp; laſt argument, to proue that the 7th day Sabbath is ſtill in force, is becauſe 1. The <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> did conſtantly obſerue &amp; keepe it, after Chriſts reſurrection. 2. The <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Churches,</hi> did obſerue and keepe it, after the dayes of the Apoſtles, for 300 or 400 yeeres after Chriſt time. 3. Our owne <hi>Church,</hi> doth daily pray to God, to incline our heartes to keepe it, and it may be thus framed.</p>
                        <pb n="467" facs="tcp:21140:251"/>
                        <p> 
                           <hi>That day wich the Apostles of Chriſt, did conſtantlie obſerue and keepe after Christs death; and which the primitiue Churches did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue &amp; keepe after the dayes of the Apoſtles, for</hi> 300 <hi>or</hi> 400 <hi>yeeres; &amp; which our owne Church, doth daily pray to God, to incline our heartes to keepe; That day is ſtill in force.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But the 7th day Sabbath, the Apoſtles of Christ, did conſtantly obſerue and keepe after Chriſts death; and the primitiue Churches, did obſerue and keepe it after the dayes of the Apostles for</hi> 300 <hi>or 400 yeeres; &amp; our Church doth daily pray to God, to incline our heartes to keepe it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore the 7th day Sabbath, is ſtill in force.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the Major or firſt propoſition, it needeth no proofe, ſo cleere it is: it conſiſteth of 3 branches as you ſee; as for the firſt of them, which is that, that day which the Apoſtles did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obſerue, is ſtill in force, or muſt be our Sabbath day, this point muſt needs be granted me; becauſe it is the very poſition of my aduerſaries: for they thus argue for their Lords day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; <hi>that, That day which the Apostles did conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly obſerue, must be our Sabbath day:</hi> Wherefore they cannot doubt of my Major.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore it may be confirmed by this, that we are bound to imitate and follow the practiſe of the Apoſtles: <hi>Be ye followers of mee, euen as I am of Chriſt.</hi> 1. Cor. 11.1. Therefore that day which the Apoſtles did conſtantly keepe, that day muſt be ſtill in force, and we muſt keepe it.</p>
                        <p>It is true indeed, if that the Apoſtles had kept a day, but now &amp; then, as once in a moneth, or once in a yeere, or once in many yeeres, (as they kept the Lords day) then it had not followed: But that day which they kept <hi>conſtantly,</hi> vſually, &amp; euery weeke, weeke by weeke, there can be no reaſon imagined, why that day, ſhould not be ſtill in vſe, in the Church. No, nor can we, with a good &amp; quiet conſcience, reiect the conſtant practiſe of the Apoſtles: If the <hi>example,</hi> yea the frequent and <hi>cuſtomary</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of the Apoſtles, ſhall not be auaileable with vs, what then will auaile with vs? In other caſes, the very mention of it, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo, or that ſome other of the Apoſtles did ſo, it is ſufficient to bind vs, to doe the like; &amp; why then ſhould we not be followers of them, in this caſe alſo, keeping that day for our
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:21140:252"/>Sabbath which they kept, &amp; conſtantly kept alſo?</p>
                        <p>As for the other 2 branches of my Major, they cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; vnleſſe men dare <hi>cenſure</hi> thoſe pureſt and <hi>primitiue Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> which liued next after the Apoſtles, as if they ſhould liue in an errour of practiſe 300 or 400 yeeres together; I ſhould rather ſuſpect our owne times then their times: Nor, vnleſſe men would make fruſtrate an holy <hi>praier</hi> of our <hi>Church.</hi> And ſo much for the Major.</p>
                        <p>I come now to the profe of the Minor, or ſecond propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: this conſiſteth of 3 branches, which I will proue in order one after an other, the firſt branch is this, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did <hi>constantly</hi> keepe the Sabbath day after Chriſts death; for this purpoſe ſee Act. 13.14. <hi>But when they were departed from Perga, they came to Antioch of Piſidia, &amp; went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day &amp;c.</hi> Here you ſee the Sabbath day in vſe; and on this day, Paul preached a Sermon to the congregation aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, as you may reade in the following partes of the Chapter. Againe, ſee Act. 13.42.44. <hi>And when they were come out of the Synagogue of the Iewes, the Gentiles beſought, that they would preach thoſe words to them the next Sabbath day: and the next Sabbath day, came almoſt the whole Citty together, to heare the word of God.</hi> Loe, here againe was an other ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preached vpon the Sabbath day: and further, note the <hi>conſtancy</hi> of keeping the Sabbath day; for here were two Sabbath dayes together kept, the one immediatly following after the other, &amp; this is ſignifind by thoſe words, <hi>the next Sabbath day.</hi> Againe, ſee Act. 16.13. <hi>And on the Sabbath day, we went out of the Citty, beſids a riuer, where they were wont to pray: and we ſate downe, and ſpake vnto the women, which were come together.</hi> Loe here, at an other time, and in an other place or Citty, the Sabbath day was kept alſo: and further it is to be noted, that on this Sabbath day, was <hi>Lydia</hi> converted; &amp; ſhee, &amp; hir houſhold Baptized. Againe, ſee Act. 17.2. <hi>And Paul, as his manner was, went in vnto them, and three Sabbath daies, Diſputed with them by the Scriptures &amp;c.</hi> Loe here, at an other time, &amp; in an other place or Citty, the Sabbath day was kept: note alſo, the conſtancy of their keeping the Sabbath, that three Sabbath dayes together were here kept, as the text ſpeaketh: note alſo, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <pb n="469" facs="tcp:21140:252"/>was no rare and ſeldome thing, for the Sabbath to be thus kept, but that it was in the Apoſtles times, a moſt ordenary &amp; conſtant thing ſo to doe; and this is ſignified vnto vs, by thoſe words, <hi>And Paul, as his manner was:</hi> So it was a cuſtome with S. Paul, to keepe the Sabbath day, euermore whereſoeuer he came. Againe, ſee Act. 18.4. <hi>And he Diſputed in the Synagogue, euery Sabbath day, &amp; exhorted the Iewes &amp; the Grecians.</hi> Loe, here againe, at an other time and in an other place or Citty, the Sabbath day was kept: &amp; note the conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of the keping the Sabbath day; for in this citty Paul kept euery Sabbath day, ſo ſaith the text, <hi>euery Sabbath day,</hi> not a Sabbath day once in a quarter of a yeere, but euery Sabbath in a yeere. What can be more plainly proued, then this point is, that the Sabbath day was kept, yea and conſtantly kept in the dayes of the Apoſtles?</p>
                        <p>Furthermore it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſhew alſo, by whom the Sabbath was kept; and here I ſhall proue vnto you, that this obſeruation of the Sabbath day, it was an <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> practiſe; and therefore the more to be regarded: for this purpoſe let vs looke backe vnto the texts fore alleaged, ſee Act. 13.13.14. <hi>Now when Paul, and they that were with him &amp;c.</hi> Where you ſee, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> kept the Sabbath day; and alſo other <hi>Chriſtianes,</hi> that accompanied him in his voyage, namly thoſe who were with Paul, as the text ſpeaketh. Againe, ſee Act. 13.43.44.46. Where mention is made of <hi>Barnabas</hi> the Apoſtle, who ioyned himſelfe with Paul, &amp; thoſe other <hi>Chriſtianes,</hi> in the obſeruation of the Sabbath day. Againe, ſee Act. 16.1.3.13.19.20. Where is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of <hi>Timotheus,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Silas,</hi> both which, ioyned with Paul in the ſanctification of the Sabbath day. Thus you haue ſeene, that the Sabbath day, was obſerued after Chriſts reſurrection, by the Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas,</hi> &amp; by <hi>Timotheus</hi> &amp; <hi>Silas,</hi> and by other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that accompanied Paul in his voyage: wherefore, we may ſafely cale, the obſeruation of the old Sabbath day, an <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> &amp; <hi>Chriſtian</hi> practiſe: for it was obſerued by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Chriſt, and by ſuch as were <hi>Preachers</hi> of the Goſpell of Chriſt: and therefore the obſeruation of the old Sabbath, hath Authority ſufficient to backe it, by thoſe that publiſhed and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Goſpell of Chriſt, vnder the new Teſtament.</p>
                        <pb n="470" facs="tcp:21140:253"/>
                        <p> Thus you haue ſeene it proued, that the Sabbath day was kept, and conſtantly kept, after Chriſts death &amp; reſurrection. 2. That it was kept by the Apoſtles themſelues, and by ſuch as publiſhed, and preached the Goſpell. 3 It ſhall not be amiſſe to ſhew you, how <hi>vniuerſallie</hi> the Sabbath was kept: for it was kept in diuerſe and ſondry places, as at <hi>Antiochia</hi> Act. 13.14.42. And at <hi>Philippi</hi> Act. 16, 12.13. and at <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> Act. 17.1.2. And at <hi>Corinth</hi> Act. 18.1.4. So you ſee, the Sabbath day was kept in theſe 4 Chriſtian Churches, to wit, in the Church at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, at Philippi, at Theſſalonica, and at Corinth: all theſe we know of.</p>
                        <p>Albeit we haue ſufficiently proued; both the Major, and alſo the firſt branch of the Minor; yet all is not done in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſome that are very ſcrupulouſe require: for ſay ſome, it is true indeede; that the Apoſtles kept the Sabbath after Chriſts reſurrection; but it was amongſt the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and in the Iewiſh Synagogues, but proue vnto vs, that euer the Apoſtles kept the Sabbath, among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But herevnto I reply.</p>
                        <p>This diſtinction of keeping the Sabbath among Iewes, but not among Gentiles is fond and vaine; for theſe men make doubtes &amp; differences, where the Apoſtles made none, as I ſhall proue vnto you: for, the Apoſtles kept the Sabbath day, among both Iewes &amp; Gentiles, ioyned in one congregation togeather: ſee Act. 18.4. <hi>And he diſputed in the Synagogue, euery Sabbath day, &amp; exhorted the Iewes and the Grecianes:</hi> Here you ſee the Sabbath was kept, both with Iewes &amp; Gentiles; for the Grecianes, were no Iewes but Gentiles, ſee alſo Act. 17.2.4. <hi>And ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, &amp; ioyned in company with Paul &amp; Silas: alſo of the Grecianes that feared God a greate multitude:</hi> Here you ſee a multitude of Grecianes or Gentiles, were preſent with the Iewes, in the ſame congregation, when Paul &amp; Silas kept the Sabbath day, as in v. 2. ſo then, the Apoſtles made no difference, in keeping the Sabbath day, betwixt Iewes &amp; Gentiles.</p>
                        <p>Neuertheleſſe I will proue vnto you, that the Apoſtles kept the Sabbath with the Gentiles, ſee Act. 13.42.44. <hi>And when they were come out of the Synagogue of the Iewes, the (Gentiles) beſought, that they would preach theſe words to them, the next Sabbath day,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:21140:253"/>&amp; the next Sabbath came almost the whole citty together, to heare the word of God.</hi> Loe, here is a moſt pregnant text for the purpoſe: for here the Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas,</hi> kept the Sabbath with <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> yea with the whole citty almoſt of the Antiochian Gentiles; wherefore, the Apoſtles made no difference of keeping the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath betwene Iewes and Gentiles: for they kept it indifferently, as well amongſt Gentiles as amongſt Iewes.</p>
                        <p>An other text whereby I ſhall proue vnto you, that the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les kept the Sabbath among the Gentiles, is Act. 16.12.13. <hi>And from thence to Philippi, which is the chiefe Citty in the partes of Macedonia, and whoſe inhabitants came from Rome to dwell there: and we weere in that Citty abiding certaine daies, &amp; on the Sabbath day we went out of the Citty, beſids a riuer, where they were wonte to pray: &amp; we ſate downe, &amp; ſpake vnto the women, which were come together &amp;c.</hi> In this text, it is to be obſerued, that theſe at Philippi with whom <hi>Paul, Timothie,</hi> &amp; <hi>Silas</hi> kept the Sabbath day, v. 3.19. they were <hi>Gentiles:</hi> for, 1. <hi>Lidia,</hi> who was then converted, &amp; ſhe &amp; hir houſhold baptized, ſhee was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, for ſhe was of the Citty of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> as the text ſpeaketh. v. 14. It doth not follow, that ſhee was a Ieweſſe, becauſe the text ſaith, ſhee was a worſhiper of God, as ſome thinke: for ſo was Cornelius alſo a worſhiper of God Act. 10.2. But yet he was no Iew, no nor ſo much as a proſelite, for he then was vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, Act. 11.3. ſecondly, it is plaine in the text; becauſe the text ſaith that theſe Philippians were Romanes: <hi>Whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants came from Rome to dwell there,</hi> v. 12. now the Romanes were not Iewes, but Gentiles: which appeareth further in v. 20.21. by the oppoſition, betwixt Iewes &amp; Romanes, <hi>Theſe men who are Iewes, trouble our City, and preach ordinances which are not lawfull for vs to receiue, ſeing we are Romanes.</hi> Theſe philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians therefore were Romanes, &amp; ſo Gentiles: and ſo it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by this text alſo, that the Sabbath day was kept among Gentiles, &amp; that the Apoſtles were as redy to keepe the Sabbath when they came among the Gentiles with the Gentiles, as they weere to keepe it when they came among the Iewes with the Iewes: they made no difference betwixt Iew &amp; Gentile for this point.</p>
                        <pb n="472" facs="tcp:21140:254"/>
                        <p> Finally, ſuppoſe it could not be proued, that the Apoſtles kept the Sabbath with the Gentiles at all, but onely with the Iewes; is it lawfull therefore to reiect the examples and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Apoſtles? if it be, then theſe abſurdeties follow, 1. That when the Apoſtles exhorte vs, to become imitatores and <hi>followers</hi> of them, as in 1. Cor. 11.1. and 1. Cor. 4-16. &amp; Phil. 3.17. then theſe textes muſt be vnderſtod, with this vaine limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that we muſt imitate the Apoſtles, onely in ſuch actiones, as they did doe among the Gentiles, but not in thoſe they did among the Iewes. 2. If we muſt imitate the Apoſtles, onely in ſuch things, as they did doe among the Gentiles; then is the example of the Apoſtles, of little or no vſe for our direction: for all their actiones well nigh, were done, among the Iewes onely, or elſe among Iewes &amp; Gentiles mixed together, as you may read euery where, ſee Act. 2.14. Act. 13.14.42. Act. 14.5. Act. 17.4.5. Act. 18.4. So much for their firſt anſwer.</p>
                        <p>An other anſwer they vſually bring, againſt the Apoſtles keeping the Sabbath day, after Chriſts reſurrection is, that it was ſo done for a time onely, <hi>to beare with the weakeneſſe of the Iewes,</hi> who would not be ſuddainly weaned from the Sabbath day, no more then they would from Circumciſion. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I reply. 1. That it was no weakeneſſe in the Iewes (I truſt) nor ſo to be eſteemed of vs, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to yeeld obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall precept, which inioyneth the Sabbath day: neither are they to rank the Sabbath day with circumciſion, ſuppoſing the Iewes to be as ſuperſtitiouſe in the one as in the other, vntil they know how as well, to proue the Sabbath day to be aboliſhed, as it is eaſy to proue Circumciſion to be aboliſhed.</p>
                        <p>If the Apoſtles keeping Sabbath, was to beare with the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> then I would gladly know, why they kept Sabbath with the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> this was not I truſt to beare with the Iewes weakneſſe, ſee Act. 13.42.44. this repetition ſermon or ſermon preached againe at requeſt of the Gentiles, it was not made for the Iewes ſake, but for the Gentiles ſake, who <hi>requeſted</hi> it: now what cauſe was there then, that Paul &amp; Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas ſhould preach this ſermon vnto the Gentiles, vpon the Sabbath day, to beare with the weakneſſe of the Iewes, for
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:21140:254"/>whoſe ſake it was not preached? had this ſermon bene preached at the requeſt of the Iewes, and ſo for their ſakes, happily this might haue had ſome better culler; but it being prached for the Gentiles ſakes, &amp; at their requeſt, it is abſurd therefore to thinke, that the Apoſtles ſhould haue regard to the Iewes in this caſe: and ſo much for the Sabbath day kept among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> Act. 13.14.42.44.</p>
                        <p>The vanity of their anſwer, will further appeare if we looke into that other Church where <hi>Paul, Timothie</hi> &amp; <hi>Silas</hi> kept the Sabbath day alſo, to wit, at <hi>Philippi,</hi> &amp; that too among the Romane <hi>Gentiles</hi> Act. 16.12.13. now forſomuch as we reade not of any Iewes dwelling at Philippi, but haue proued the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, nor can they proue that any dwelt there, who could thinke, that S. Paul and the reſt, ſhould keepe the Sabbath there, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauor of the Iewes? or for the weakneſſe of the Iewes? ſince there were no Iewes either in that Citty, or in their Aſſemblies, of whom the Apoſtles ſhould be afraied, or for whoſe ſakes they ſhould doe it.</p>
                        <p>But here it is anſwered, that albeit there were no Iewes in this Citty or Aſſembly, yet if Paul had not kept the Sabbath here, it would haue bene by one meanes or other carried to the Iewes where they dwelt, whereat they would haue bene offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; therefore Paul kept the Sabbath here at Philip. But how vaine this conceipt is appeareth. 1. Becauſe this ſuppoſeth, that the Apoſtle durſt not free the Gentiles, from the obſeruation of needleſſe ceremonies in their owne Church, for feare he ſhould offend the ſuperſtitiouſe Iewes in ſome other remote Church. 2. By the like reaſon, Paul ſhould not haue reproued Peter for Iudaizing in the Church of Galatia, Gal. 2.14. nor haue durſt to ſpeake againſt Circumciſion; nor to haue wrote to the Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians againſt Meates and drinkes, new Mones, &amp; yeerly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, Coloſ. 2.16. for by one meanes or other, this would haue come to the hearing of the Iewes, &amp; offended them. 3. By this it ſhould haue come to paſſe, that there ſhould haue bene no place left in the world for the Apoſtles to haue begune a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Iewiſh ceremonies, if they durſt not refaine them for feare it ſhould come to the hearing of the Iewes: wherfore the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:21140:255"/>Apoſtles kept not the Sabbath at Philippi for to pleaſe the Iewes onely, nor onely for feare of offending them.</p>
                        <p>Yet further, there is not want of good reaſon, to ſhew that the Apoſtles kept not the Sabbath for the weakneſſe of the Jewes onely: this being laied for a grownd, that if they be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to keepe it for the weakneſſe of the Iewes onely, that then it was a ceremony &amp; ſo aboliſhed, my reaſons are theſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Apoſtles kept it <hi>voluntarily,</hi> &amp; when they might haue auoided it, as appeareth. 1. Becauſe the Apoſtles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained <hi>certaine daies</hi> with the Church at Antioch Act. 13.42, 44. and with the Church at Philippi Act. 16.12. Now any day of the Sixe had bene as fit for the Gentiles, as the Sabbath, if the Sabbath was a ceremony. 2. Becauſe the Gentiles <hi>beſought</hi> the Apoſtles to preach to them the next Sabbath day Act. 13 42. Now what is obtained by requeſt of Superiors, is at their liberty to grant: now can any thinke the Apoſtles would vſe an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed ceremony, when it was at their choiſe and libertie to vſe it or not? foraſmuch as the <hi>ſtrong ought to beare the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the weake,</hi> it was a <hi>burden</hi> for an Apoſtle to vſe a Iewiſh Ceremony: and would the Apoſtles then take an vnproffitable burden on their backes, when they might auoide it?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If the Sabbath was kept for the weakneſſe of the Iewes, and ſo appeared to be but a Ceremony, then had the Apoſtles rune vpon ij dangerouſe rockes. 1. As touching the Iewes, how could this but harden the heart of the Iewes in their <hi>Iudaiſme,</hi> and retaining ſtill of Ceremonies, when they ſaw S. Paul, the greateſt enemy to Ceremonies of all the Apoſtles, to obſerue the Sabbath day ſtill, not onely when he was among them, but wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer be came, yea among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo; 2 As touching the Gentiles, if the Sabbath had bene kept for the weakneſſe of the Iewes onely, as a ceremony, then had S. Paul by keeping the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath among the Gentiles, infected them with <hi>Judaiſme</hi> by his practiſe: yea, &amp; ſo taught them that now in practiſe, which he muſt afterwards beate downe &amp; vnteach againe by Doctrine; Thus the Apoſtles ſhould be ſuppoſed to make themſelues worke: firſt to infect, &amp; then to heale &amp; cure: further, if their anſwer be good, then was Paul <hi>bound,</hi> to permit &amp; ſuffer the
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:21140:255"/>Chriſtian Churches in Iudaiſme; for the <hi>ſtrong ought to beare the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        <p n="3">3. To ſuppoſe the Apoſtles to keepe the Sabbath among the Gentiles, for the weaknes of the Iewes, is abſurd: for by ſo doing the Goſpell ſhould receiue no aduantage: for looke what a ſuperſtitiouſe Iew was eaſed therby, by ſo much a beleeuing Gentile was burdened &amp; combered; he being intangled with a Iewiſh Ceremony: now what were this better then if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſhould pull a thorne out of the foote of a Iew, and thruſt it into the foote of a Gentile?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Obſerue, that S. Paul was the Doctour of the Gentiles Gal. 2.7. Now by Gentiles here, we muſt not vnderſtand ſuch congregations as conſiſted only of Gentiles: for of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which Paul planted there were fewe ſuch, but for the moſt parte they were all a mixed people, of Iewes &amp; Gentiles both, as you may ſee Act. 17.2.4. Act. 18.4. Act. 19.10. Act. 13.14.42. Act. 14.5. wherefore, ſuppoſe yee that the Sabbath had no where bene kept among the Gentiles, that is, in ſuch a congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin there were none but Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles; yet is the cauſe the ſame ſtill: for firſt, it is plaine that Paul kept the Sabbath frequently in theſe Churches, which were mixed of Iewes and Gentiles, ſee Act. 17.2.3. Act. 18.4. And ſecondly, it is plaine, that theſe were the Churches which Paul planted, &amp; ouer whom he was ſet: now if the keping of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> had bene a ceremony, as <hi>meats</hi> &amp; <hi>drinkes</hi> were, then had Paul committed a foule <hi>errour</hi> by vſing of this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony in his Churches, the Churches of the Gentiles: for he had <hi>conſtrained</hi> therby the Gentiles vnto Iudaiſme; the which fault, he ſorely reproued Peter for Gal. 2.14.12. For, Pauls keeping the Sabbath muſt as well conſtraine the Gentiles to Sabbathizing, as Peters refraining of Meates, did conſtraine theſe Gentiles to doe the like.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If Paul did <hi>Sabbathize</hi> among the Gentiles, for the weaknes of the Iewes onely, and that ordenarily and cuſtomarily, for ſo he did Act. 13.14.42.44. Act. 17.1.2. Act. 18.4. Then this abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dety followeth, that Paul did alſo <hi>circumciſe</hi> the Gentiles, for the weakneſſe of the Iewes, and that ordenarily and cuſtomarily: for
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:21140:256"/>there is as greate reaſon, that Paul ſhould haue vſed circumciſion among the Gentiles, in fauor of the Iewes, as to haue vſed the Sabbath day among the Gentiles, in fauor of the Iewes: for the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes were as zealouſe for circumciſion as they were for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. Herevnto I might alſo add, that Paul muſt as well haue vſed their <hi>new moones,</hi> &amp; abſtinance from prohibited <hi>meates,</hi> among the Gentiles, for the ſake of the Iewes, as the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, if theſe were all alike Ceremonies, and if there were no more morallity in the Sabbath, then in the new moones and prohibited meates.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. As touching things indifferent, and the Ceremoniall Law, Paul became <hi>all things vnto all men &amp;c.</hi> Vnto the <hi>Iewe</hi> who had the Ceremoniall Law, he <hi>became a Iewe;</hi> &amp; vnto the Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>fe <hi>without Law,</hi> he vſed no Ceremonies: from this text then thus expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it is plaine, that Pauls Sabbathizing among the Gentiles, it was no Ceremony, nor done for the weakneſſe of the Iewes: for among the Gentiles he was <hi>without law,</hi> that is, he vſed no Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: To thinke otherwiſe, were to thinke that Paul did not onely vnto the Iewe become a Iewe, but abſurdly that vnto the Gentile alſo he became a Iewe.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. If the Sabbath was a Ceremony, and obſerued, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in thoſe Churches where he kept it, for the weakneſſe of the Iewes, then this abſurdety followeth; that he did not roote out Ceremonies, or refraine Iudaiſme in thoſe Churches; &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that he left behind him, many famouſe Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, peſtered with Ceremonies, &amp; infected with Iudaiſme: for he kept the Sabbath day in many famouſe Churches, ſee Act. 13.14.42.44. Act. 16.12. Act. 17.2. Act. 18.4. Now if Paul was forced to obſerue Ceremonies, for the weakneſſe of the Iewes at that time, then ſo muſt he for the ſame cauſe, haue done euer after during his life: for the Iewes remained weake in this matter of Ceremonies, to Pauls dying day: ſince that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, that Ceremonies had for their honourable buriall among the Iewes, vntill the diſtruction of the Temple, which was about 50 yeeres after Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <pb n="477" facs="tcp:21140:256"/> 8. It cannot be that the obſeruation of the Sabbath was a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, &amp; kept for the weakneſſe of the Iewes onely, among the Gentiles: for, if any Iewes could be offended at the neglect of Ceremonies, they were thoſe at Ieruſalem as much as any: for they were all ſtill <hi>zealouſe of the law,</hi> that is, the law Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall. Act. 21.20. Now theſe Iewes, the very chiefe of them, as the Apoſtles &amp; Elders, they had <hi>determined</hi> it, &amp; <hi>written</hi> vnto the Gentiles, that they ſhould <hi>obſerue no ſuch things,</hi> that is, that they ſhould obſerue no Ceremonies Act. 21.18.25. How then can we thinke, that S. Paul, who was euer an enemy vnto Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Act. 21.21. ſhould be ſo forward, as to obſerue the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, if it were a Ceremony? yea, and that too in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Gentiles, contrary vnto the <hi>decrees</hi> and <hi>determinations</hi> of the Apoſtles and Elders at Ieruſalem, made againſt the vſe of Ceremonies among the Gentiles? &amp; ſo much for confutation of this their ſecond anſwer, wherevpon I haue dwelt the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, becauſe it is their chiefe anſwer, wherin they put greateſt conſidence.</p>
                        <p>A third anſwer they make to my argument, againſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles keeping of the Sabbath day is this, that the Apoſtles muſt take ſuch dayes as they found in vſe in the Church then, or elſe they could not preach &amp; divulge the Goſpell: and the Iewes would aſſemble then on no dayes but on the Sabbath dayes, according to their auncient cuſtome.</p>
                        <p>Herevnto I reply ſaying, that whereas the enemies to this moſt auncient ordinance of Gods Sabbath, doe faine a neceſſity vpon the matter, as if the Apoſtles were compelled to keepe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; this is but a forged fiction of their owne braines: for the Apoſtles knew how to divulge &amp; make knowne the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, albeit they had neuer preached on the Sabbath day, nor taken the opportunity of the Iewes aſſemblies, &amp; Synagogues: for they could preach it, from houſe to houſe, in priuate how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen; as we read they did ſometimes, <hi>&amp; daily in the Temple, and in enery houſe, they ceaſed not to teach, and to preach Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Act. 5.42. And when Paul forſoke preaching in the Iewes Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues and aſſemblies, he could find other places to teach &amp; to preach in; &amp; therefore we reade, that he taught a longtime, in the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:21140:257"/>Schole of one <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> and there aſſembled vnto him both Iewes &amp; Gentiles, for the <hi>ſpace of two yeeres.</hi> Act. 19.8.9.10. and this place he found out to teach in, after he left the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and Synagogue of the Iewes, as you may ſee in the text: &amp; therefore it is but a forged invention, to ſay, that the Apoſtles, muſt take the opportunity of the Iewes aſſemblies, to preach vnto them when they were aſſembled; there was no neceſſity of it, as you ſee. And it is but a forgery of them to ſay, that the Iewes would not aſſemble on any dayes but on their Sabbath dayes: as if they would not heare Gods word, out of the Sab. bath day, as well as out of the Synagogue: and as if the Apoſtles ſhould preach daily, but the people did not heare daily Act. 5.42. &amp; ſee Mat. 5.1. with Mat. 4. laſt. Yet further, Paul could aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; gather together the Iewes, at his pleſure, as you may reade he did Act. 28.17. <hi>And the third day after, Paul called the chiefe of the Iewes together, &amp; when they were come, he ſaid vnto them &amp;c.</hi> Now he did not cale them together into the Synagogue, but into a priuate houſe, as you may ſee v. 16. And further, not onely the Iewes, but the very chiefe of the Iewes (as the text ſpeaketh) refuſed not to come at his cale: And therefore, Paul was not compelled to ſeeke out them, and to goe into their aſſemblies, &amp; Synagogues; for he could cale for them to come vnto him, &amp; that vnto his Chamber or lodging. Yet further, Paul being a priſoner, <hi>remained two yeeres in an houſe hired for himſelfe,</hi> and thither the people came vnto him, to be taught &amp; inſtructed in the kingdome of God, &amp; thoſe things which concerne the Lord Jeſus, as you may read Act. 28.30.31. It is therefore an idle plea, to ſay, that the Apoſtles muſt take the opportunity of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Iewes, then to preach vnto them; as if there could be no other time for the Apoſtles, but onely that time wherein they were mett in their Synagogues, to preach Chriſt in.</p>
                        <p>But happily it will be ſaid, that though this time, wherin the Iewes were aſſembled in their Synagogues, on the Sabbath day, was not neceſſary, yet it was the moſt opportune &amp; fit time for the Apoſtles to preach in. Herevnto I anſwer, when an <hi>oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi> &amp; an <hi>inconuenience</hi> meete, the greater of the two is to be regarded: Pauls care was ſo to inſtruct the Iewes touching
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:21140:257"/>Chriſt alredy come, as he might therewithall, beate downe all Ceremonies &amp; ſhaddowes of Chriſt to come: for, <hi>He taught the Jewes among the Gentiles, to for ſake Moſes, and circumciſion, and the Iewiſh cuſtomes.</hi> Act. 21.21. Now if the Sabbath day, was a Ceremony and a ſhaddow of Chriſt to come (as theſe men ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) &amp; then Paul ſhould frequent the Iewes aſſemblies orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily &amp; vſually, weeke by weeke vpon the Sabbath day, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe keeping the Sabbath with them; this were of dangerouſe conſequence, leaſt it ſhould fleſh &amp; hearten the Iewes in their hard heartedneſſe, to thinke that Chriſt was not yet come, ſince that the Sabbath was a ſigne (as is holden) of Chriſt to come: &amp; further, it was of dangerouſe conſequence, leaſt it ſhould ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne all Pauls doctrine, when they heard him preach that the Meſſias was come, and yet they ſawe him keepe the Sabbath with them, which ſignified that Chriſt was ſtill to come: Yea, it was perillouſe vnto the Iewes that were beleeuing Iewes, that by this meanes, they might be ſtill retained, in a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſe opinion of Ceremonies, when they ſaw Paul keepe them with them ſo generally, and ſo conſtantly: Now let all theſe inconveniences, or but any one of them, be put into the ballance, with that oppertunity of preaching to the Iewes, whilſt they were aſſembled after their wonted manner; and then tell me whither of the twaine is the greater, &amp; whither muſt giue place vnto the other: doubtleſſe, Paul would not hazard the leaſt of theſe inconveniences, for to gaine that opportunity of the Iewes aſſembly; he would rather haue made a new aſſembly of them, vpon ſome other day, &amp; in ſome other place, then to haue put them into ſuch perill of danger: for Paul was moſt carefull to weane them from Ceremonies; &amp; ſo much for their third &amp; laſt anſwer.</p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee, we haue proued the keeping of the Sabbath day was an <hi>Apostolicall</hi> practiſe, &amp; to be imitated &amp; followed of vs: &amp; haue alſotake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away whatſoeuer they can obiect to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: but ſuppoſe we could onely haue proued, that the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les did <hi>conſtantly</hi> obſerue the Sabbath day, yet in this haue we done and ſaid much more in defence of the Lords Sabbaths, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue ſaid, or can ſay, in defence of the Lords day, who are
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:21140:258"/>patrones of it: this Lords day Sabbath, were it not the <hi>Diana</hi> and darling of our time, &amp; ſupported by men of learning, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and zeale, I would ſay of it, that it is the moſt idle &amp; friuolouſe thing, that cane be invented; for beſids other defects in it, they cannot proue a conſtant practiſe of it, no nor that it was euer kept weeke by weeke, two Lords daies together, one after an other, in any place, nor at any time: I can but wonder therefore, that any man, that hath but either learninge or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, ſhould after the conſideration of theſe things, preferre the Lords day aboue the Sabbath day, or neglect the ancient ordinance of Gods Sabbath day, to imbrace this nouill Sabbath of the the Lords day.</p>
                        <p>I haue now finiſhed my 12th &amp; laſt argument, as touching the firſt branch of it, wherin I haue proued, that the Apoſtles of Chriſt, did conſtantly keepe the Sabbath day, after Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: &amp; now I am to procede, and to proue vnto you, the ſecond branch of my Minor or ſecond propoſition, which is, <hi>That the primitiue Churches, which liued after the daies of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, kept the Sabbath day, for</hi> 300 <hi>or</hi> 400 <hi>yeeres after Chriſt.</hi> And this trueth I ſhall confirme vnto you by ſondry Teſtimonies.</p>

                        <p>I will begine with that which M. Perkins reporteth, ſaying, <hi>The obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sabbath, was neglected of thoſe Churches which ſucceeded the Apoſtles, but afterwards, it was establiſhed by Chriſtian Emperours:</hi> his Author for it is <hi>Leo</hi> &amp; <hi>Anton Edict,</hi> of <hi>Holy daies:</hi> Perk. in his firſt volume, vpon the 4th com. pag. 48. by the word Sabbath M. Perkins vnderſtandeth the Lords day Sabbath: Now of this Lords day, he ſaith according to his author, that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which ſucceded the Apoſtles, they neglected it vntill it vvas eſtabliſhed by Chriſtian Emperours; now theſe Churches, were the primitiue Churches, for they liued immediatly after the Apoſtles: &amp; they liued in the neglect of the Lords day Sabbath, for about 300 yeeres after the daies of the Apoſtles; as is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therable by this, that he ſaith, it was eſtabliſhed by Chriſtian Emperoures: now the firſt Emperour that eſtabliſhed the Lords day, was <hi>Constantine</hi> the greate, as ſaith Hoſp. Cap. 9. pag. 27. &amp; this Conſtantine, liued aboute 300 yeers, after the Apoſtles:
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:21140:258"/>now for aſmuch as theſe Churches, liued about 300 yeeres with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Lords day Sabbath it followeth, that they all that time kept the 7th day Sabbath; vnleſſe we ſhall <hi>vncharitably</hi> cenſure them, to haue liued <hi>profanly</hi> without any Sabbath day all that while, which were abſurd to thinke: many Churches kept both Sabbaths together, to wit, the Sabbath day, and the Lords day, as you ſhall ſee by and by; now can it be thought, that ſome of the Primitiue Churches, ſhould be ſo zealouſe, as to keepe two daies, &amp; other ſome ſo key could, as to keepe none at at all? wherefore, ſince theſe Churches kept not the Lords day, therefore it muſt follow, that they kept the Sabbath day: thus you ſee it followeth, that the Sabbath day was in vſe in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue times, for about 300 yeeres after the Apoſtles: ſo then as the Apoſtles kept the Sabbath day, conſtantly, after Chriſts reſurrection; ſo the primitiue Churches that ſucceded next after the Apoſtles, they kept it for a matter of 300 yeeres longer.</p>

                        <p>My next Teſtimony ſhall be out of the <hi>Centuries:</hi> where it is thus recorded, <hi>Romae conventus eccleſiasticos non fuiſse in Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bato, quemadmodum in aliarum terrarum eccleſiis:</hi> Centur iiij.

                        <p>My third Teſtimony ſhall be from an acte made by the <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicean Counſaile</hi> in the yeere of Chriſt 364. <hi>Laodicenum Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium celebratum circa annum</hi> 364 <hi>ſanxit: Non oportere Iudaizare Christianos, &amp; in Sabbatho vacare, ſed potius operari in eadem die, Dominicam praeponendo Sabbatho: quod ſi inventi fuerint Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thum Judaeorum obſervantes, anahemate ibidem feriuntur. Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin: de origin. Feſt. Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 27. The ſumme whereof is this; <hi>The Laodicean Counſaile held about the yeere</hi> 364 <hi>made a Law, that Chriſtianes ſhould not Judaize, &amp; reſt vpon the Sabbath day, but rather worke vpon it; &amp; that they ſhould praeferre the Lords day aboue the Sabbath day. And if ſo be any were found obſeruing the Iewes Sabbath, they ſhould be excommanciated or accurſed.</hi> By this Law then it appeareth, that the Sabbath day, was in vſe in thoſe times, for elſe this Law had bene made in vaine, which forbad Chriſtians to kepe the Sabbath day any more, vpon paine of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; for gouernes doe not enact Lawes againſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. 2. Note, that as the Sabbath day was in vſe in thoſe times, ſo alſo it was in vſe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gft <hi>Christianes:</hi> for this law as you ſee, was bent againſt the practiſe of Chriſtianes, forbidding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianes to keepe the Sabbath day; whereby we ſee, that in theſe times, the Sabbath day was honoured among Chriſtianes. 3. Note, that vnto this time Chriſtianes did honour the Sabbath day with or aboue the Lords day: &amp; this I gather from hence, becauſe this Counſaile ordeined, that for time to come, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes ſhould <hi>preferre</hi> the Lords day before the Sabbath: now they neded not to haue made a law, to bind Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to preferre the Lords day before the Sabbath day, if they had done ſo before the making of this law; &amp; this is a remarkabl thing, that in theſe times the Sabbath day was had in ſuch honour with Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as it was as highly, or rather more highly ſet by then the Lords day was. 4. Note the time; this Law was made 364. yeeres or there about after Chriſt: whereby we ſee, that the Sabbath day, was in vſe amongſt Chriſtianes, for nere 400 yeeres after Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>A digreſſion, by the way ſhewing 1. the Invalidity of this Laodicean Counſaile &amp; Decree, made againſt the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths.
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:21140:259"/>2. The Originall of the Lords day Sabbath. 3. The time when, and the perſones by whom, the ancient Sabbath was firſt throwne downe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt of the firſt, that this Decree made againſt Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, is not to be regarded or eſteemed, ſhall thus appeare, becauſe it was an vngodly act &amp; decree: for they made a Law directly againſt Gods Law: for God ſaid, Remember the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, to ſanctify it: but they decreed, that no Chriſtianes ſhould obſerue the Sabbath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> day, to ſanctify it: and therefore this Counſaile, was guilty of that brand of that wicked one, Prophecied of by Daniel, <hi>Who ſhould ſpeake words againſt the moſt high, and thinke that he may change times &amp; Lawes.</hi> Dan. 7.25. Now this Counſaile, did here change <hi>times,</hi> to wit, ſacred times, ſanctified of God, the Sabbath day; and decreed, that this time ſhould now be profaned, &amp; men, yea Chriſtians ſhould profane it by working on it: &amp; further, they changed this day for an other day, to wit, the Lords day, caſting downe ſinfully the Sabbath day, &amp; ſetting vp in its roome, and preferring aboue it ſuperſtitiouſly the Lords day.</p>
                        <p>And as this decree againſt the Lords Sabbaths, was vngodly in them, ſo was it <hi>Schiſmaticall</hi> alſo: for they now begane not onely to decline from ancient purity, but alſo to <hi>rend</hi> Chure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and to diuide betwixt Church and Church, Chriſtianes &amp; Chriſtianes: for other Churches which liued about their time, &amp; together with them, kept that ancient ordinance of Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as we haue proued already out of <hi>Perkines,</hi> and out of the <hi>Centuries,</hi> and as you may perceiue by thoſe Teſtimonies which you ſhall ſee by &amp; by; and other Chriſtanes, kept the Sabbath alſo, euen among themſelues; as appeareth by their law inacted againſt Chriſtians, for keeping the Sabbath day; thus it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, they rent themſelues, both from thoſe other Churches li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing then with them, and from Chriſtianes then in their owne Church alſo: You ſhall ſee by and by alſo, how this Counſaile, hath made a rent from the Churches, whereof thoſe famouſe lights <hi>Athanaſiius</hi> &amp; <hi>Ignatius</hi> were Biſhopes, &amp; which liued before this Counſaile, &amp; therby you ſhall perceiue, how they haue made a Schiſme &amp; rent alſo, from the moſt ancient and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:21140:260"/>Churches, that liued before them.</p>
                        <p>Neither is any man to wonder at this, for if we conſider what was Prophecied of this Church of Laodicea, whereof this Counſaile hath its name, we can expect no better from it: for of all the 7 Churches, which <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote vnto in his Reuelation, this of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> it was the worſt: and therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>becauſe thou art luke warme, &amp; neither could nor hote, it ſhall come to paſſe, that I will ſpue thee out of my mouth Reuel.</hi> 3.16. Chriſt here forteld them, that it ſhould come to paſſe, that he would ſpue them out of his mouth, as moſt loathſome vnto him; and thinke you that they did not well deſerue it at this time; when they begane to make a Schiſme &amp; rent from other the Churches of Chriſt, and to change Gods time: and to enact lawes againſt Gods Law? conſidering therefore, what an vnzealouſe Church, Chriſt foretould this Laodicean Church ſhould be, it therefore is not to be regarded, what they decreed againſt Gods Sabbaths.</p>
                        <p>Yet further, if we ſhall note the time wherein this Counſaile liued, and made this decree, their decree will grow more ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſe, and leſſe to be regarded: for it was 364 yeeres after Chriſt; about which time, begane the Myſterie of iniquity to worke: for the purity of the primitiue Churches, begane to decline and be Ecclipſed then, &amp; ſuperſtition &amp; popery, begane to inſinuate it ſelfe, and creepe into the Churches: for thoſe pure Churches of the primitiue times, are compared to a riuer, the which the further off it runneth from the ſpring heade, the more filth it gathereth, &amp; ſo it was with theſe Churches: for, as you may reade in <hi>Perkins</hi> his <hi>Demonſtration of the probleme,</hi> about the 300 and 400 yeeres after Chriſt, then begane <hi>Images</hi> to creepe into Churches, The <hi>Croſſe</hi> to be adored, <hi>Invocation of Saints, prayers for the dead, Pilgrimage, Purgatory, Single life of Miniſters, Monkery, &amp; Monaſticall profeſſion &amp;c.</hi> Till at laſt they had corrupted the <hi>ſecond commandement</hi> by Images, Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſixes, and the breaden god: now what maruaile, that they had alſo corrupted the 4th com. and aboliſhed the Lords Sabbaths, when thoſe times had corrupted the ſecond commandement? wherefore their decree made neere 400 yeers after Chriſt, is to be ſuſpected, becauſe then was the time of the Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:21140:260"/>and faleing away, from their former purity.</p>
                        <p>A ſecond thing to be obſerued by the way, from the decree of this Counſaile, is to note the <hi>Originall</hi> and firſt vpſpringing, of our new Sabbath, caled the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as a ſole Sabbath, and generally receiued; The pite out of which it was digged, is the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Counſaile; the Antiquity that can be alleaged for it, it is no higher thë 364 yeeres after Chriſt; for, 1. vntill about the time of this counſaile, &amp; ſince hitherto, this Lords day was neuer <hi>generally</hi> receiued in the Chriſtian Churches, for the Churches whereof Perkins ſpeaketh, wich liued immediatly after the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, they neglected the Lords day, for a matter of 300 yeers, vntill Chriſtian Emperours eſtabliſhed it; it is true, that Conſtantine enacted a Law for the generallobſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lords day, which was 300 yeeres after Chriſt, and ſo a matter of 64 yeeres before this Counſaile; but in Conſtantines time, the Lords day was not kept <hi>as a ſole</hi> Sabbath; for the Sabbath day was then kept alſo, as by &amp; by we ſhall proue by <hi>Athanaſius</hi> who liued in Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines time. 2. Vntill the time of this Counſaile, and ſince, the Lords day was neuer receiued and kept for <hi>a ſole</hi> Sabbath, as now it is: for before the time of this Counſaile, the Sabbath day, and the Lords day, were both kept together, in many Chuches, as you ſhall ſee by thoſe Teſtimonies which by &amp; by I ſhall produce, out of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and from <hi>Jgnatius,</hi> but now, at the time of this Counſaile, begane the Sabbath day to be reiected, and alſo the Lords day, to be ſet vp as the ſole Sabbath without any other: and now the Lords day muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth be preferred before the Sabbath day: and ſo you ſee the firſt Originall of our Lords day Sabbath, to be a ſole Sabbath, was this Counſaile of Laodicea.</p>
                        <p>The third and laſt thing to be obſerued is, that here we take knowledge, of the perſones by whom, the Lords Sabbaths were firſt throwne downe, and of the time when they were firſt throwne downe. The perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es that did commit this horriblefact they were that lukewarme people of the Church of, <hi>Laodicea:</hi> none others durſt attempt to <hi>change</hi> Gods times, &amp; to make a ſacred time become a profane time but theſe: the time when, it was in that declined time, to wit, 364 yeeres after Chriſt: the
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:21140:261"/>former times, which were the more pure times, they durſt not lay violent hands of Gods ordinance: thus we ſee when, &amp; by whom Gods Sacred Sabbaths were rooted out of the Church. Thus my digreſſion finiſhed, I returne whence I came.</p>

And then his anſwer is this, <hi>It is commonly thought (ſaith hee) that the Iews Sabbath, was changed into this Lords day, by Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, long after the Aſcention of Chriſt.</hi> Perk. in his Expoſition vpon the firſt Chapter of the Reuelation; and verſe the 10th. In which words M. Perkins doth deliuer, though not his owne, yet the <hi>common</hi> opinion and iudgment of others: now the common opinion is (ſaith hee) that the Iewes Sabbath was changed, long after Chriſt his Aſcention; and that by Chriſtian Emperours: ſo then, it is the common opinion, that the Sabbath day laſted in the Churches, a long time after Chriſt his Aſcention; euen 300. yeers.</p>
                        <p>For Doctour <hi>Prideaux,</hi> ſaieth he in his worke vpon the Sabbath pag: 140, <hi>Annon Sabbathum Iudaeorum oum Iudaeis, ſine ſcrupulo &amp; murmure obſeruarunt Apoſtoli? caetus in Sabbatho coactos liben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſsime instituerunt?

Notiora ſunt ista quam vt probatione indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant.</hi> The ſumme whereof is this, <hi>did not the Apoſtles (ſaith hee) obſerue the Iewes Sabbath, with the Iewes, without the least ſcruple making? &amp; did they not most willingly appoint aſsemblies on the Sabbath day? and did not the Church which followed them, appoint both the Sabbath day &amp; the Lords day, for holy aſsemblies, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe yeeres? theſe things are ſo well knowne that they need not to be proued.</hi> By whoſe Teſtimony, you ſee, that the Churches which followed the Apoſtles, they obſerued and kept the Sabbath day, for diuerſe yeeres: &amp; this is ſo plaine by Hiſtory, that it needeth not any quotations or profe.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>M. Brerewood, Profeſſor</hi> in Greſham College in London, in his Treatiſe of the Sabbath day, againſt <hi>M, Byſield</hi> pag. 77.
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:21140:261"/>thus writeth: <hi>And little doe you know (ſaith hee) of the ancient condition of the Church if you know it not, that the ancient Sabbath, did remaine &amp; was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, together with the Lords day, by the Chriſtians of the Easterne Church, aboue</hi> 300 <hi>yeers after Chriſts death &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>The Sabbath of the 7th day, was religiouſly obſerued in the East Church,</hi> 300 <hi>yeeres &amp; more, after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours paſſion.

                        <p>My ſixth Teſtimony ſhall be out of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the ſumme where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this. <hi>Aſſemblies were wonte to be in the Churches, euery weeke, vpon the Sabbath day, &amp; vpon the Lords day.</hi> Socrat. Chap. 8. lib. 6. &amp; againe, <hi>At Ceſarea, Cappadocia, &amp; in Ciprio, vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, &amp; vpon the Lords day, the Preſbiters &amp; Biſhopes did euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more interpret &amp; expound the Sciptures.</hi> Socrat. Cap. 21. lib. 6. here you ſee, a weekly obſeruation of the Sabbath day; &amp; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practiſe of Preſbiters and Biſhopes, to expound the holy Scriptures vpon the Sabbath day.</p>
                        <p>But before I proceed any further, it ſhall not be amiſſe, to anſwer a doubt, that may riſe in the minds of ſome that reade theſe Antiquities: may they ſay, what did the primitiue Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches keepe two Sabbath daies euery weeke? for it ſeemeth ſo; becauſe they kept both the Sabbath day, and the Lords day. For anſwer hereto, we muſt know, that howbeit they kept two daies, yet it is not to be thought, that they kept them both for Sabbath daies, reſting from labour all day long, according to the 4th com. for, 1. This were more then euer God required in his morall Law, to reſt two daies in Seauen. 2. <hi>Jgnatius</hi> put
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:21140:262"/>a difference betwixt the Sabbath day, and the Lords day, as betwene the King and the Quene: for he caled (as you ſhall ſee by &amp; by) the Lords day, the quene of daies, hereby intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Sabbath day whereof he ſpake alſo in that place, was the King of daies. 3. The Chriſtianes, againſt whom the Laodicean Counſaile, enacted that law foreſpoken of, they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the Sabbath day aboue the Lords day, as there we ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. 4. Many Churches of Chriſtianes, they kept not the Lords day at all for 300 yeeres together, as we haue ſhowne out of Perkines. 5. In Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantines time he gaue leaue for men to goe to plough, and other workes of huſbandry on the Lords day, as elſe where we haue ſhowne: by all which it is more then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the primitiue Curches, though they kept the Lords day, yet they kept it not for a Sabbath day, or like the Sabbath day, but rather much like as we now keepe a common Holy day, or a lecture day, wherin we come to Church &amp; heare the word of God, but we keepe not the whole day, in a reſt from laboures &amp; in conſcience of the 4th com. thus you ſee, albeit they kept two daies in a weeke, yet but one onely was kept for their Sabbath, the other was kept lightly and partially: they kept theſe two daies in a weeke then, much like as we now kepe the Lords day, and ſome light Holy day; or the Lords day &amp; a Eecture day, when they fall both in one weeke.</p>

                        <p>My ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th Teſtimony ſhall be that of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who liued about the time of Conſtantine, 300. yeeres after Chriſt: who in his <hi>Homilie de Semente</hi> ſaith thus; <hi>Wee aſsemble together in the Sabbath day, not as if we were infected with Iudaiſme, but therefore wee meete together in the Sabbath day, that we may worſhip Ieſus the Lord of the Sabbath. Centur. iiij. Cap. vj.</hi> pag 410. In which words, we ſee what was the practiſe of the Chriſtian Curches, in the daies of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> for then they kept the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> as we ſee here.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it is worth our obſeruation to conſider, that Athanaſius doth not onely &amp; barely auowch it, that they then kept the Sabbath day; but moreouer, he doth <hi>Iuſtify</hi> &amp; <hi>defend</hi> their keeping of it: for whereas ſome might obiect vnto him
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:21140:262"/>ſaying, but doe your Churches keepe the Sabbath day ſtill? why that is <hi>Iudaiſme</hi> &amp;c. of this mind was the Laodicean counſaile, that liued not long after Athanaſius: and it ſeemeth that this ſlaunderouſe opinion of the Sabbath, was creeping into the Church in the daies of Athanaſius, &amp; growne to ripeneſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a matter of 60. yeeres after him: for now the Laodicean counſaile durſt cale it Iudaiſme in plaine termes, for Chriſtianes to keepe the Sabbath day; but ſee how this famouſe Athanaſius, &amp; godly Biſhop, foreſeeing this miſcheife, meeteth with the priuy obiectiones of ſome in his time, who were alredy infected with this leauen, ſaying, <hi>not as if we were infected with Iudaiſme:</hi> The iudgement therfore of this Godly Biſhop was, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, might ſanctify the Sabbath day, without any tainte or tincture of Iudaiſme. I wiſh all Miniſters now, would learne to know of Athanaſius, that to keepe Gods Sabbath, it is no Iudaiſme. but how is it to be lamented to ſee the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, rather to follow that Schiſmaticall decree, of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> caling the keeping of Gods Sabbath Judaiſme then to follow that famouſe <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who defendeth it, that the keeping of the Sabbath day, is no Iudaiſme.</p>
                        <p>Further, it is to be noted, that the Chriſtian Churches, in the time of Athanaſius, kept the Sabbath day, and that this was about 300 yeeres after Chriſt; ſo that the Sabbath day was in vſe with Chriſtianes, for 300 yeeres after Chriſt. Now the firſt 300 yeeres after Chriſt, are accounted for the moſt pure times, &amp; the freeſt from corruptiones: and the after times were leſſe puer, abateing of their purity daily, as the Church grew elder; now foraſmuch as the Sabbath day, was honourable amongſt Chriſtianes, and religiouſly obſerued in the moſt puer times, this is much to be regarded; for what if the Sabbath day begane to be trampled vpon, and counted for <hi>Iudaiſme,</hi> 60 or 100 yeeres after theſe puer times? whats that to vs? for if we follow any, we will chooſe rather to imitate the more puer Churches (I truſt ſo) then thoſe that were leſſe puer; now the more puer Churches (as you haue ſeene it abundantly proued) they kept the Sabbath day: To conclude, ſo long as the Churches retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their beſt purity, ſo long the Lords Sabbaths were in vſe &amp;
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:21140:263"/>honour; but when the Churches begane to decline and fale away, as to ſet vp <hi>Images;</hi> to adore the <hi>Croſse;</hi> to pray to <hi>Saints;</hi> to pray for the <hi>deade;</hi> to beleeue a <hi>purgatory;</hi> and the like, then they begane to eſteeme the Lords Sabbath <hi>Iudaiſme,</hi> that ſo they might forſake them, and ſet vp dayes of their owne invention: but my truſt in God is, that as he hath cauſed a reformation, of the abuſes of the ſecond commandement, which crept into the Church in thoſe times; ſo the ſame God will find a time, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the abuſes of the 4th com. alſo, which crept in then too, but remaine to this day vnreformed.</p>

                        <p>My eight &amp; laſt Teſtimony, ſhall be that of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who liued about an 100 yeeres after Chriſt: <hi>Let not vs (ſaith hee) keepe the Sabbath day, in a Iewiſh manner, pleaſing our ſelues with a reſt or idleneſse: for he that will not labour let him not eate &amp;c: But let euery one of vs, keepe the Sabbath day Spiritually, reioyceing in the meditation of the lawe: not in a remiſneſse or idleneſse of the body; but in an admiration of the workemanſhip of God; not reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceing in daunceings, and vnciuill Showtinges &amp;c. And after the Sabbath day, let euery one that loueth Chriſt celebrate the Lords day, beinge the quene of dayes &amp;c. Ignat. in his Epiſtle to the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianes.</hi> In this exhortation of Ignatius, we may note. 1. That hee ſpeaking both of the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> doth inſinuate a plaine difference betwixt them, as touching their eſtimation: for the Lords day he counteth as the <hi>queene</hi> of daies, and ſo leaueth a place for the Sabbath day, to be in account as the <hi>King</hi> of dayes: yea ſpeaking of the Sabbath day, he vſeth the word <hi>Sabbathizare,</hi> but ſpeaking of the Lords day, he vſeth the word <hi>celebrare.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. We may note, that hee ſpeaking of the Sabbath day, doth conſider it doublie; firſt, as the Iewes in thoſe dayes did vſe it, or abouſe it rather, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="491" facs="tcp:21140:263"/>of Sabbath keeping, Ignatius did abhorre, ſaying it is better for the Iewes to labour on the Sabbath day, then thus to keepe it: <hi>for he that will not worke (ſaith hee) let him not eate;</hi> which words are to be referred vnto the Iewes, not vnto the Chriſtianes to whom he wrote, vnleſſe they would ioyne with theſe profane Iewes in reuelling and roioting on the Sabbath day: by which manner of ſpeaking, Ignatius alludeth vnto a like forme of ſpeech vſed by God himſelfe, in a like caſe, ſaying, I <hi>cannot ſuffer your new Moones, nor Sabbaths &amp;c. My ſoule hateth them &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 1.3. Now God did not ſimply hate their Sabbaths, ſince he had commanded them; but he hated their irreligiouſe &amp; hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticale obſeruation of the Sabbaths; and ſo Ignatius did not meane ſimply, that the Iewes ſhould worke vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, or elſe they ſhould not eate; but comparatiuly, and reſpectiuly, as if he had thus ſaid, rather then men ſhould keepe the Sabbath, as doe the Iewes, in reuelling, &amp; ſporting, &amp; idleneſſe, let them be forced to labour &amp; worke in it, by denying them foode: for it is better to worke on the Sabbath day accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that commandement which inioyneth labour. 2. Theſ. 3.10. then to reſt according to that commandement. Exod. 20.10. when a man dothit onely to pleaſe the fleſh, and not to further him in the worſhip of God: it is better to keepe no Sabbath, then to keepe it onely in a carnall manner: honeſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is better on the Sabbath then carnall ſlouthfull &amp; reuelling reſt: Now this kind of profane &amp; carnall keeping of Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, is that which Ignatius doth admoniſh Chriſtians of, and doth dehorte them from, ſaying, Let not vs keepe the Sabbath as doe the Iewes, or in a Iewiſh manner &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>In the next place Ignatius ſpeaketh of the Sabbath, as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes ought to keepe it: &amp; that is, not profanly and carnally, but religiouſly and Spiritually; But let euery one of vs (ſaith hee) keepe the Sabbath <hi>Spiritually:</hi> and then he proceedeth to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the dueties of the Sabbath particularly, the one whereof is, to reioyce in the meditation and Diuine contemplation of the Law of God: <hi>reioyceing in the meditation of the Law:</hi> the other is, to make an holy admiration, of the Creation of the world, &amp; of the prouidence of God in the gouernance of the ſame &amp;c.
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:21140:264"/>
                           <hi>In an admiration of the workmanſhip of God:</hi> Now vnto this Holy, Spirituall, &amp; religiouſe obſeruation of the Sabbath day, did Ignatius exhorte thoſe Chriſtians vnto whom he wrote, ſaying, <hi>But let euery one of vs, keepe the Sabbath day &amp;c.</hi> In which exhortation, you ſee that Ignatius did not onely permit: the keeping of the Sabbath day, among Chriſtianes; but he goeth further then ſo; for he falleth to a plaine &amp; right downe exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and perſwaſion of Chriſtians to keepe the Sabbath day, <hi>Let euery one of vs (ſaith hee) keepe the Sabbath day.</hi> What ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bemore plaine? had Ignatius eſteemed the obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sabbath day, an aboliſhed ceremony, as many thinke now a daies; or Iudaiſme, as thoſe of the Laodicean Counſaile thought it, who liued 200 yeeres after Ignatius; and as many of vs now a dayes iudge it to be; he would neuer haue exhorted and perſwaded <hi>Chriſtianes</hi> to the obſeruation of it.</p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee, that ſo long as the Church was in its greateſt purity and perfection, ſo long it retained in honour the Lords Sabbaths: for Ignatius liuing ſo neere vnto the time of the Apoſtles, he liued in the moſt flouriſhing eſtate of the Church for purity: and euen in theſe ſo pure times, was the Sabbath day in honour &amp; vſe; &amp; ſo continued, vntill the Church begane to decline, which was 200 yeeres after this time, about which time they begane to corrupt the ſecond Command. &amp; what maruaile if they then alſo made hauocke of the 4th commandement too? but this I ſay, ſo longe as the primitiue Churches, remained in their greateſt purity, ſo longe Chriſtians retained the Lords Sabbaths in honour &amp; vſe, &amp; thus much for the ſecond branch of my Minor, ſo hitherto we haue proued theſe two things, the former, that the Apoſtles of Chriſt, did conſtantly obſerue the Sabbath day, in their time: the other, that the moſt pure &amp; primitiue Churches which followed the Apoſtles, kept the Sabbath, ſo long as they kept their purity, which was 300 or 400 yeeres after Chriſt: &amp; now I am come to the third &amp; laſt branch of my Minor.</p>
                        <p>The 3d branch of my Minor or ſecond propoſition, which I am to proue is, <hi>That our Church doth daily pray to God, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline our heartes to keepe this Sabbath day.</hi> I ſhall not neede to
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:21140:264"/>goe farre for the proofe of this point: for our daily prayers to God, euery Sunday or Lords day, in the Congregation, will confirme it: for the Miniſter, as it is ordered by our Church, in the booke of Common prayer, rehearſeth to the whole Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, the 10. Commandements of Almightie God, &amp; among the reſt hee repeateth the 4th Com. ſaying, <hi>Remember the Sah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, to keepe it holy &amp;c. But the 7th day, is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt not doe any worke &amp;c. for the Lord rested the 7th day, and therefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</hi> Now as ſoone as this Commandement, touching the 7th day Sabbath, is rehearſed in the audience of the people; It is by our Church ordered, that the whole Congregation ſhall herevnto ſubioyne this deuout prayer, <hi>Lord haue mercie on vs, and incline our heartes to keepe this lawe.</hi> And thus you ſee, that our Church doth ratify the Sabbath day, by praying daily to God, to incline our heartes to keepe it.</p>
                        <p>But happily ſome may ſay, our Church doth not intende by this hir prayer, to ratify the 7th day Sabbath, which is the Iewes Sabbath. Herevnto I reply, that by this hir prayer, ſhe muſt be vnderſtod to pray to God to incline our hearts, either to the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the 7th day Sabbath, or to the keeping of the Lords day Sabbath: now ſtrongly I am perſwaded, that the <hi>Reuerend Biſhopes</hi> of our Church will not ſay, that the 4th com. doth command vs to keepe the Lords day; &amp; therefore when we pray to God, to incline our heartes to the keeping of the 4th com. we cannot vnderſtand our prayer, to be meant of the Lords day: for it is not the day caled Lords day, which the 4th Com. inioyneth; but it is the day called Sabbath day, as you ſee in the Commandement: and it is not the Lords day, which the Miniſter pronounceth in reading the 4th com. but it is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, which he ſpeaketh of: neither is it the 8th day, or firſt day of the weeke which the 4th com. ſpeaketh of; but it is the 7th day, and laſt day of the weeke which the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mentioneth: neither is it the 8th day, or firſt day of the weeke, or Lords day, where in God reſted at the Creation, but it is the 7th day wherein God reſted, as the Commandement ſaith: neither is it the Lords day, which the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſaith
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:21140:265"/>God bleſſed and hallowed; but it is the day caled Sabbath day, which God bleſſed and hallowed, as the 4th commandement ſpeaketh: wherefore, when the Miniſter ſaith Remember to Sanctify the Sabbath day: if then we ſhall pray thus, Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline our hearts to keepe the Lords day; doe we not ſo make anſwer, as ſometimes deafe men doe, who when a man caleth for a knife, they bring him the ſheath? &amp; when the Miniſter telleth the people which day is the Sabbath day, ſaying, But the 7th day is the Sabbath of the Lord; if then we ſhall pray thus, Lord incline our heartes to keepe the 8th day; are we not then like thoſe that come to Church when the Sermon is done? &amp; that goe to ſell comodities, the day after the fayer? yea were not this to bable with God, and to profane this Holy ordinance of prayer? when the prayers of the Church cane be taken but ij. waies, it is a very abſurd thing, &amp; vncharitable, for any man to expound them in the worſer ſenſe, which is a falſe and abſurd ſenſe: wherefore ſince the Lords day cannot be mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayer, therefore the Sabbath day muſt be meante: for there is none other but one of theſe two that can be imagined, and thus I haue proued, the 3d branch of my Minor, to wit, that our Church doth pray to God daily, to incline our heartes to keepe the Sabbath day, &amp; ſo theſe 3 points are proued. 1. That the Apoſtles kept the Sabbath day. 2. That the primitiue Churches after them kept it. 3. That our Church daily praieth to God to keepe it: wherefore, if the conſtant practiſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles &amp; the religiouſe practiſe of the moſt ancient and primi tiue Churches after the Apoſtles; &amp; the daily prayers of our Church will any thing auaile with vs; then muſt we ſanctify the 7th day Saturday Sabbath.</p>

To imitate God, is to doe as like him, &amp; to come as neere him as poſſible we can: now no day of the weeke, is ſo like the day wherin God reſted, as our Saturday the 7th day; becauſe God reſted on the Saturday 7th day: nor can we come ſo nere God, in practiſe on any day of the weeke, as we may on our Saturday which is the 7th day. So much for the Maior.</p>
                        <p>I come to the Minor, to wit, that we muſt imitate God, in his keeping of the 7th day Sabbath: and this I proue, 1. in generall: for the Scriptures doe frequently ſet God before vs for our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torne, &amp; exhorte vs, to be imitators &amp; followers of him, as Eph. 5.1 <hi>Be yee followers of God as deere children &amp;c.

This reaſon made by God to the creature, muſt ſtand in force, till hee reuerſe it, which yet he hath not done nor doth.</hi> Thus M. <hi>Perkins</hi> affirmeth the trueth of my Minor, moſt fully.</p>

                        <p>Herevnto ſome may ſay, the example of God, was for the old day, for the 7th day &amp;c. To them I ſay, they ſay the trueth: what other day is commanded in the 4th com- then the old day? the 7th day? can they thinke the 4th &amp; old com. ſhould command any new day? as the 8th day? or can Gods example agree to any new day? ſurely this old 4th com. is for none other then for an old day, and ſo is Gods old example.</p>

Exod. 20.8. &amp; yet reiect Gods reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> annexed therto, to ſtirre vp to the obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; as if Gods reaſon were forceleſſe, &amp; vſeleſſe: theſe thinke they haue no need of Gods <hi>exſamples</hi> to leade &amp; moue them to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. 2. They abſurdly faine, that this reaſon taken from Gods Reſt on the 7th day at the Creation is <hi>Iewiſh,</hi> and Gods enſample, belonging vnto the people of the Iewes onely, or elſe why will they reiect Gods example? loue they not to be followers of God? or ſhall the Iewes onely be the followers of God, but not Chriſtianes? 3. If you ſay this reaſon belongeth not vnto vs Chriſtianes, then doe you caſt a foule blurre vpon our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines <hi>Muſculus, Perkines,</hi> &amp; <hi>Dod</hi> with many others, who haue expounded, &amp; applied this reaſon from Gods example, vnto vs Chriſtianes: yea <hi>M.

                        <p>I conclude, if we will become <hi>followers</hi> of God, &amp; imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him, as he hath preſcribed in his 4th com. then muſt we ſanctifye the Saturday 7th day Sabbath.</p>

                        <p>My 14th argument, for maintenance of the Saturday Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is, becauſe wee may, together with Antinomia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Libertines,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:21140:267"/>&amp; Anabaptiſts, as well aboliſh all the Morall Law by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as with them aboliſh the Saturday Sabbath, and thus I argue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>If wee may, together with Libertines, Antinomians, &amp; Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, aboliſh by the Scriptures, the Saturday Sabbath as a Jewiſh Ceremony; Then may wee with them alſo, aboliſh by the Scriptures, the wholl Law of God, euen all the tenn commandements, as Jewiſh Ceremonies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But neither wee may, nor yet may thoſe lawleſſe Christians; of Libertines, Antinomians, &amp; Anabaptists aboliſh by the Scriptures, the wholl Law of Gods tenn commandements, as Iewiſh ceremonies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore wee may not, together with Libertines, Antinomians, &amp; Anabaptists, thoſe lawleſſe Chriſtians, aboliſh by the Scrïptures, the Saturday Sabbath, as a Iewiſh Ceremony.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For profe of the conſequence; it is well knowne, that thoſe Lawleſſe Chriſtians of <hi>Libertines, Antinomians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Anabaptiſtes,</hi> doe reiect the Santification of all Sabbaths: not but that they keepe the Lords day as a Sabbath, together with thoſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches amonge whom they liue; but they keepe it onely as an ordinance of the Magiſtrate, and as in obedience to their gouerners; yet ſo too, as in caſe they could doe any common ſeruile worke on the Lords day, without offence to any, they would, and doe profeſſe it that they would: but to keepe any Sabbath, as a Diuine inſtitution, and as an ordinance of Gods, and by virtue of the 4th commandement, this they doe reiect as Iewiſh, and Ceremoniall: and for their warrant, among other textes of Scripture, as wee doe, ſo doe they alleage Exod. 31.13. &amp; Coloſ. 2.16.17. againſt the Saturday Sabbath, ſhewing that it is aboliſhed, as a ſigne and ſhaddow &amp;c. Thus they bring Scripture againſt the old Sabbath, as well as wee, &amp; the ſame Scriptures that we bring: ſo then, wee are iuſtly ranked with Libertines, Antinomians, and Anabaptiſts, for aboliſhing by the Scriptures, the ancient Sabbath day.</p>
                        <p>Now J procede to proue the Major (for as for the Minor, it needeth no profe) if wee may by theſe Scriptures Exod. 31.13. &amp; Coloſ. 2.16.17. Together with theſe Sectaries, aboliſh the Saturday Sabbath, which is one thing commanded in the morall
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:21140:267"/>Law; then may we together with them alſo, by theſe Scriptures Eph. 2.15. Heb. 7.12. Heb. 10.1. Col. 2.14. Aboliſh the wholl Morall Law, &amp; all things commanded therein: the reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is plaine and manifeſt: for theſe Sectaries doe bring Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt the wholl Law of God, as well as againſt that one parte thereof, which commandeth the Saturday Sabbath: now if we will ſhake hands with them in the one, why not in the other alſo? if we will ioyne with them, in vrging &amp; preſſing theſe textes Exod. 31.13. Coloſ. 2.16.17. Againſt the 7th day Sabbath, which is one branch of the Law; why then ſhould we not by the ſame reaſon, ioyne with them alſo, in vrging &amp; preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe other textes Eph. 2.15.7.12. Heb. 10.1. &amp; Col. 2.14. Againſt the wholl Law &amp; euery branch thereof, and ſo aboliſh it too? thers the ſame equity for both, let vs not therefore aboliſh Gods Sabbath day, vnleſſe we minde to turne Anabaptiſts and Antinomians, and aboliſh the wholl Law alſo.</p>
                        <p>Happily it will be thought, ther is not ſo good reaſon, to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the wholl Law, by theſe Scriptures which theſe Sectaries doe alleage againſt it, as there is in thoſe other Scriptures, which they alleage againſt the Saturday Sabbath: But for this matter, I ſhall make it appeare, that (as theſe Sectaries, haue as little cauſe to vrge theſe textes, againſt the wholl Morall Law, as they or wee, haue to alleage thoſe textes againſt the old Sabbath day, ſo) they haue as good cauſe &amp; as ſtrong reaſons, to alleage theſe textes againſt the wholl Law, as they and we haue to alleage thoſe textes againſt the old Sabbath day: for this purpoſe, let vs compare the textes on either partes.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, for the textes brought againſt the Sabbath day, Exod. 31.13. &amp; Coloſ. 2.16.17. Here ſay they &amp; wee, the Sabbath in the Morall Law is made a <hi>ſigne,</hi> &amp; a <hi>ſhaddow:</hi> now all ſignes &amp; Shaddowes, are aboliſhed at Chriſts coming, hee being the ſubſtance of thoſe ſhaddowes. 2. In the text Col. 2.16.17. Say they and wee, here we haue the very thing in queſtion, expreſſy mentioned, namly Sabbaths, and Sabbaths too in the plurall number, &amp; ſo all Sabbaths both weekly &amp; annuall, in the Morall Law and in the Ceremoniall Law, are aboliſhed: Now on the other parte, for the textes brought againſt the wholl law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:21140:268"/>Heb. 10, 1. <hi>for the Law hauing a ſhadow of good things to come &amp;c.</hi> Where the things commanded by the Law, are called a ſhadow: hence I thus reaſon, if the Sabbath commanded in the Morall Law be aboliſhed, becauſe Sabbaths commanded in a Law are a ſhadow; Col. 2.16.17. Then are all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Morall Law aboliſhed (and conſequently the Law alſo) becauſe things commanded in a Law are a ſhadow. Heb. 10.1. Is not there as good reaſon for the one, as for the other? come we to the other textes alſo, ſee Eph. 2.15. Col. 2.14. Heb. 7.12. Where it is ſaid, there is <hi>a chang of the Law:</hi> &amp; that the <hi>handwriting of ordinances is put out:</hi> &amp; that the <hi>Law of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements is abrograted,</hi> In which texts it is affirmed, that the law is aboliſhed: here then may they ſay in like manner, in theſe textes we haue the thing in queſtion expreſly mentioned, namly the Law: &amp; by Law in Scripture is ſomtimes meant, both the Morall &amp; Ceremoniall Law Mal. 2.7. And ſo the wholl Law is aboliſhed, both Morall and Ceremoniall: well then, hence I thus reaſon, if the Sabbath in the Morall Law be aboliſhed by Col. 2.17. Becauſe there is mention of <hi>Sabbaths</hi> aboliſhed; then muſt not the Morall Law, be aboliſhed alſo by Eph. 2.15. Col. 2.14. &amp; Heb. 7.12. Becauſe here is mention made of the <hi>law</hi> aboliſhed? is there not the ſame reaſon in both? for if you will extend the word Sabbaths, which is onely vnderſtod of the Sabbaths in the Ceremoniall Law, vnto the Sabbath inioyned in the Morall Law; why may not they extend the word Law, which is onely vnderſtode of the Ceremoniall Law, vnto the Morall Law? &amp; whereas you alleage, that in Col. 2.16.17. There is mention of Sabbaths in the plurall number, and therefore all kinds of Sabbaths weekly and anniuerſary muſt be aboliſhed; why may not they, and you with them, argue alſo and ſay, that in Eph. 2.15. and in Col. 2.14. There is mention of ordinances &amp; commandements, in the plurall number, and therefore are all Gods ordinances, and all Gods commandements, whither in the Morall Law or in the Ceremoniall aboliſhed?</p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee then, there is as good reaſon for vs, to ioyne with Antinomians and Anabaptiſtes in caſting away the Morall Law, as to ioyne with them in caſting away the Sabbath day, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:21140:268"/>in the Morall Law: we may as well caſt away by the Scriptures miſapplied, euen all Gods commandements, and all Gods ordinances, as Gods Sabbath day: we may as well turne Anabaptiſts in wholl as in parte, and reiect all things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Decalogue with them, as any one thing therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. To conclude, vnleſſe we will iuſtify thoſe Sectaries in deſtroying the whole Law of Gods 10 commandements, let vs as we ought, raiſe vp Gods Sabbath againe.</p>

                        <p>My 15th. argument in defence of the Saturday Sabbath is, that it muſt be morall: becauſe if you aboliſh the Sabbath day by the Scriptures, you muſt alſo by the Scriptures aboliſh the <hi>law</hi> of the Sabbath day, which is the 4th commandement, and thus I argue.</p>

                           <hi>Jf by the interpretation of the Scriptures, you aboliſh the Saturday or 7th day Sabbath; then by the interpretacion of the Scriptures, muſt you alſo aboliſh the Law of the Saturday or 7th day Sabbath, which is the 4th com,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>For the Minor, it is out of queſtion: for euery man granteth, that the <hi>law</hi> of the Sabbath, the 4th com. is morall; and that it were horrible impiety to aboliſhed it, any more then to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any of the reſt of the Decalogue: and how be it they ſay, that ſomething in this Law is aboliſhed, as the <hi>time</hi> of the 7th day, yet as for the Law, it retaineth its commanding and binding force ſtill as they doe confeſſe: I come therefore vnto the Major, to proue the conſequence thereof.</p>
                        <p>How beit the point is cleere enough of it ſelfe, yet ſuch is the enmity of men to Gods Sabbaths, as rather then they will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, they will queſtion any cleere trueth: for whats more cleere then this, take away the thing (yea any thing) commanded in a Law, and take away the Law thereof? take away the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, commanded in the 4th com. and you take away the
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:21140:269"/>4th com. alſo? there are many lawes in the old Teſtament, which are now aboliſhed; let my aduerſaries ſhew me any one of them, wherein any thing once commanded, was aboliſhed, but that that Law it ſelfe alſo was aboliſhed: if then it be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant interpretation of Scriptures, to iudge when a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in a Law is aboliſhed, that then that Law is aboliſhed, then ſo it muſt be in this caſe alſo: take away the Sabbath day, &amp; take away the Law of the Sabbath day, for example.</p>
                        <p>There was a Law made touching the difference of <hi>Meates,</hi> Leuit. 11. Now the Apoſtle ſhewing vs, that the difference of meates is taken away, Coloſ. 2.16. hence we conclud, that not onely that difference of meates is taken away but alſo that law, which commanded that difference of meates is taken away: Againe, there was a Law for the obſeruation of <hi>New-Moones</hi> Numb. 28.11. which was to ſanctify the firſt day of euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: Now the Apoſtle ſhewing vs, that thoſe New-Moones are aboliſhed, Coloſ. 2.16. hence we conclud, that that Law of the New-Moones is aboliſhed alſo. Againe, there were diuers Lawes made, for the keeping holy of diuerſe anniuerſary Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, Leuit. 23.7.21.24.32.35.39. now the Apoſtle ſhewing vs, that thoſe yeerly Sabbaths, are all aboliſhed, Coloſ. 2.16. hence we gather, that together with the abolition of thoſe Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, all thoſe lawes made for thoſe Sabbaths, are aboliſhed alſo, it is cleere therefore, that if you aboliſh the weekly Sabbath, which is Saturday the 7th day, you muſt alſo from thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by which you aboliſh it, aboliſh alſo the Law of it, which is the 4th com.</p>
                        <p>A ſecond reaſon J take from Coloſ. 2.14.16. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle aboliſhing thoſe yeerly Sabbaths in v. 16. doth alſo aboliſh the <hi>Lawes</hi> of thoſe yeerly Sabbaths in v. 14. &amp; that vnder the name of <hi>hand-writting of ordinances,</hi> ſhewing how Chriſt vpon the croſſe did put out, and aboliſhed this hand writting of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that is thoſe <hi>Lawes</hi> &amp; ordinances, of thoſe many yeerly Sabbaths; whence I thus argue, if by this 16th verſe of Coloſ. 2. you will aboliſh the weekly Saturday 7th day Sabbath, then muſt you by the 14th verſe of Coloſ. 2. aboliſh alſo that <hi>Law,</hi> handwriting, &amp; ordinance of the 4th com. which belonged to,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:21140:269"/>&amp; was made for the weekly Sabbath day: for, looke what Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath daies you include in v. 16. The Lawes of thoſe Sabbath daies, you muſt include in v. 14. &amp; ſo aboliſh them: for it is plai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Here by the way note, that ſince Anti-Sabbatharians will haue nothing in the 4th com. morall but the dueties of Reſt &amp; Holy exerciſes, therefore let them know, they ſhall haue no Law for theſe dueties; they ſhall not preſſe to the practiſe of theſe dueties by any Law: for in that they will haue the 7th day Sabbath a ceremony, &amp; included in the text, Col. 2.16. thereby they haue aboliſhed the Law of the dueties of Reſt &amp; holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, by Coloſ. 2 14. &amp; then their Lords day Sabbath ſhall be a lawleſſe Sabbath; &amp; the dueties of the time &amp; Reſt, &amp; holy exerciſes ſhall be lawleſſe dueties.</p>

                        <p>My 16th argument in defence of Gods Sabbaths is, that the time, to wit, the 7th day, muſt be morall and perpetuall; or elſe thoſe <hi>dueties</hi> performed in that time by the 4th com. to wit, reſt from labour, and holy exerciſes, theſe muſt be ceremoniall and aboliſhed: as in the former argument we haue proued, that if they aboliſh the 7th day, they aboliſh alſo the Law of the 4th com. ſo in this we ſhall proue, that if they a boliſh the 7th day, they doe alſo aboliſh the <hi>dueties</hi> inioyned in the <hi>Law</hi> of the 4th co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. and ſo farrewell Law &amp; dueties both: Thus I argue.</p>

                        <p>

                        <p>As for the Minor it is gaine ſaid by none. J come therefore to the Maior, the conſequence whereof J proue to be ſound, from the practiſe of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in Scripture, who, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he aboliſheth the <hi>day</hi> &amp; <hi>time</hi> once commanded, he thereby inferreth, the abolition alſo, of thoſe <hi>dueties</hi> to be done in that day and time.</p>
                        <p>For example, on the firſt day of euery moneth, which was their <hi>New moone,</hi> the Iſralites were bound to reſt from laboures Amos 8.5. &amp; to be conuerſant about religiouſe exerciſes ij. king. 4.23. now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Holy Ghoſt did put an end to theſe dueties, he did onely mention the time &amp; day, as, <hi>Let no man condemne you in reſpect of the New mone,</hi> Coloſ. 2.16. Gal. 4.10. and by abolition of the time, hee inferred the abolition of thoſe
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:21140:270"/>dueties alſo performed in that time. Againe, the Iſralites had many yeerly Sabbaths, wherein they were to reſt from labour, &amp; to be conuerſant in holy dueties, as you may reade at large, Leuit. 23. now when the Holy Ghoſt would put an end to theſe dueties he did onely mention the time &amp; day <hi>as, yee obſerue times, and daies, and yeeres &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 4.10. Rom. 14.5. Coloſ. 2.16. and by his abolition of the times and daies, he inferred the abolition alſo, of thoſe dueties of reſt, &amp; holy exerciſes perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in thoſe times, now this practiſe of the holy Ghoſt, giueth vs to vnderſtand, that where the time is aboliſhed, there thoſe dueties vſually performed in that time, are aboliſned alſo: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you will aboliſh the time and day, to wit, the Iewiſh Sabbath day (as ſome call it) then if you will fetch light from the Scriptures, you muſt learne of the Holy Ghoſt, to aboliſh alſo thoſe <hi>Iewiſh</hi> dueties, of reſt, &amp; religiouſe exerciſes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in that day and Iewiſh time.</p>

                        <p>My 17th argument for defence of the Saturday Sabbath, prouing that it muſt be morall and ſtill in vſe is, becauſe it is a parte of Gods worſhip: and thus I argue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>All the partes of Gods worſhip, compriſed in the first Table of the morall Law, which were written by the finger of God in Tables of stone, are morall &amp; now in force.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But the ſanstification of the Saturday or 7th day Sabbath, is a parte of Gods worſhip, comprized in the firſt Table of the morall Law, and was written by the finger of God in Tables of ſtone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore the Sanctification of the Saturday or 7th day Sabbath, is morall and now in force.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the Major, it is not onely a trueth, but alſo a trueth of that importance and conſequence, that there ſhould be no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian found (me think) dareing to deny it: for he that denieth it, doth deny God ſome parte of his worſhip; he denieth that God ſhould haue his wholl worſhip; and will giue God but ſome
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:21140:271"/>peeces thereof onely: now what God hath ioyned together, how dare any man to put them aſſunder? the Almightie, in ſetting man a platforme of his worſhip, diuided it into fowre partes, &amp; commanded it by fowre ſeuerall commandements, which make vp together the firſt Table of the Decalogue or Morall Law, and ſo the wholl worſhip of God, compleate in all the partes thereof; now how ſhall any man dare by his deniall of this trueth, to put theſe aſunder, and to plucke any one of theſe partes from its fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, but that he muſt be guilty of heinouſe impiety, &amp; horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacriledge? if it was ſo heinouſe, to <hi>rob God of his Tithes &amp; Offerings</hi> Mal. 3.8. what is it, to rob him of his <hi>worſhip and ſeruice!</hi> if not one <hi>iote</hi> or <hi>title</hi> of the Law ſhall faile, ſo long as heauen and earth endure Mat. 5.18. with what warrant may any man ſay, that a parte of Gods worſhip, preſcribed in that Law is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed? as ſafely may a man clipe the Kings coyne, as clipe, pare off, or diminiſh any parte of Gods worſhip: the higheſt &amp; worſt degree of impiety and vngodlineſſe in a Chriſtian, is to turne Athieſt and to deny God; and the next vnto it, is to deny God his worſhip and ſeruice, in wholl or in parte: now this they muſt doe who deny my Major. Nay which is worſe, they doe not onely deny God a part of his worſhip, but alſo they muſt accovnt it <hi>Iew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I confeſſe indeed, ſome textes are brought to proue the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of one parte of Gods worſhip, to wit, the old Sabbath day, as Exod. 31.13. Coloſ. 2.16.17. But theſe are but clokes, to couer their euill dealing with God, vnder a pretenſe of Scripture: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this parte of Gods worſhip, hath bene out of vſe in the Church now a longe time, &amp; becauſe it is now growne through neglect of it into reproch, as to be called Iewiſh, Ceremoniall, and a circumſtance with the like, therefore to colour the matter ouer, men haue abuſed theſe textes of Scripture; but ſuer I am, it is more out of a deſire and will men haue to reiect this parte of Gods worſhip, then any thing elſe, that theſe Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:21140:271"/>are alleaged: for there is nothing in theſe textes for that purpoſe, neceſſarily prouing ſo much, but onely that they who alleage them are wilfull, and will make them of larger extent then they neede to doe. I deſire theſe words (neceſſarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing) may be well obſerued, ſince I place greate Emphaſis in them: for an ancient ordinance of Gods, is not to be <hi>vnneceſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> &amp; <hi>voluntarily</hi> aboliſhed, as if men were weary of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and did ſtudy how to aboliſh &amp; reiect his ordinances, and lay waſt Religion. Now whither it will ſtand with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for any man to aboliſh any parte of Gods worſhip vvhen he needes not, &amp; vvhen there is no neceſſity by any thing in thoſe textes to doe it, I leaue it to all men to iudg of.</p>
                        <p>I come to the Minor, &amp; here I am to proue, that to ſanctify the Saturday or 7th day Sabbath, is a parte of the vvorſhip of God; &amp; this I proue firſt in <hi>generall;</hi> for it is a generall receiued trueth, that all the things command in the firſt Table of the Decalogue, are the partes of Gods vvorſhip; yea, &amp; they are Gods imm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate vvorſhip, as <hi>Polanus</hi> in his <hi>Syntag.</hi> pag. 558. ſaith; if then the firſt Table of the Decalogue commandeth the vvorſhip of God, the ſanctification of the Saturday and 7th day Sabbath muſt needes be a parte of the worſhip of God; becauſe it is commanded with the other partes of Gods worſhip, in the firſt Table of the Decalogue. 2. I proue it <hi>particularly,</hi> and that by the Teſtimony of two worthy Diuines; the one is <hi>Vrſinus</hi> in his Catech. on the 4th command. pag. 637. where ſpeaking of the old Sabbath day, he expreſly ſaith of it, that <hi>it was tyed to the 7th day, and that the obſeruation thereof was neceſsary, and it was the worſhip of God:</hi> thus hee. The other is <hi>M. Perkines</hi> in his caſes of conſcience pag. 108. where he expreſly affirmeth, that <hi>the Iewes Sabbath, was both the time of Gods worſhip, &amp; alſo a parte of Gods worſhip.</hi> Thus I haue made good the Minor, to wit, that the Saturday 7th day Sabbath, was commanded of God, as <hi>a parte of his worſhip.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By the way, it is to be noted, that albeit men ſleit this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Gods ancient Sabbath, caling it, but a <hi>circumſtance</hi> of <hi>time,</hi> and the like, yet you ſee it cleerly proued, that it is ſuch a circumſtance as is not to be ſleited; for it is <hi>a parte of Gods
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:21140:272"/>worſhip.</hi> I conclude, the Saturday Sabbath muſt be morall and ſtill in vſe; becauſe it is a parte of Gods worſhip: and becauſe if any deny it, they are enemies to Gods intire and wholl worſhip and ſeruice; for they doe diminiſh it, and detracte from it, they pare of from it &amp; clype it, as Traitoures doe the Kings Coine, making it lighter and leſſer then his Maieſtie coined it for.</p>

                        <p>My 18th argument, for the maintenance of the ancient Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day is, that it muſt be Morall and ſtill in vſe: becauſe it was obſerued by Chriſtians, with the approbation of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> after the death of Chriſt, and abolition of all Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And thus I argue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The obſeruation of that thing by Christianes, after the death of Chriſt, and abolition of all Ceremonies, which the Holy Ghoſt recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to poſterity, by way of approbation and commendation, that is no ceremony, but morall and ſtill in force.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But the obſeruation of the old Sabbath day, was celebrated by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, after the death of Chriſt, and abolition of all Ceremonies, and was recorded by the holy Ghoſt to all posterity, by way of approbation &amp; commendation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore the obſeruation of the old Sabbath day, is no ceremony but a morall &amp; ſtill in force.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the Major, there can be no doubt of it: for ſince that all Ceremonies had their period and laſt date, at Chriſts death vpon the Croſſe, it cannot be thought, that the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> would giue the leaſt commendation or approbation, of any Ceremony practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed after the death of Chriſt, at which time all Ceremonies had their end; vnleſſe we ſhould thinke the holy Ghoſt would build vp againe, what Chriſt had throwne downe: it cannot be thought, the Holy Ghoſt would giue any approbation of a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, vnto poſterity and the Chriſtian Churches ſucceding: wherefore the obſeruation of Chiſtians, commended by the holy Ghoſt, after the death of Chriſt and all Ceremonies, muſt be iudged a Morall.</p>
                        <p>I come to the Minor, the trueth of which I proue out of Luk. 23.56. <hi>And they returned and prepared odoures, and oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and reſted the Sabbath day, according to the commandement.</hi>
                           <pb n="509" facs="tcp:21140:272"/>Jn which text, we may note theſe particulers for the profe of our point. 1. that the parties who reſted this Sabbath day, they were Chriſtians, namely, Chriſtian women, as <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioanna,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of <hi>Iames,</hi> and other women with them, as the text ſpeaketh Luk. 24.10. 2dly, we may note, that this Sabbath day, was ſanctified after the death of Chriſt: for Chriſt ſuffered the day before it. 3dly, it was ſanctified after the abolition of all Ceremonies: for all Ceremonies ended vpon Chriſts Croſſe, as we reade in Coloſ. 2.14. So that an end was put vnto all Ceremonies, on the day before this Sabbath was ſanctified. 4thly, the ſanctification of this Sabbath day, was recorded by the Holy Ghoſt, vnto all ſucceding Churches, as we find it and reade it in this text at this day. Yea, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, theſe women preferred the Sabbath day, before the embalming of the ſacred body of our Lord Ieſus: for conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe hote countries, it had bene very needfull to haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed the dead body before it had bene 3 dayes dead; &amp; yet as needfull as it was, they neglected it, preferring the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath before it; &amp; this zeale of theſe holy women, hath the holy Ghoſt recorded vnto poſterity.</p>
                        <p n="5">5thly, that the holy Ghoſt recorded this, by way of approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and commendation of their fact; appeareth hereby, 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth ranke it together with other remarkable and commendable facts: for he recordeth it with that commendable fact of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> who begged the body of Ieſus of Pilate, tooke it downe from the Croſſe, wrapped it in a linnen cloth, and laid it in a new Tombe Luk. 23.50. &amp;c. And with that laudable facte of thoſe <hi>women,</hi> who obſerued the place where they laid the body of Chriſt, prepared odoures &amp; oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and on the firſt day of the weeke erly in the morning, they went vnto the Sepulchre to embalme the body of Chriſt Luk. 23.55.56. Luk. 24.1. now together with theſe laudable actiones, is rekoned vp alſo the religiouſe ſanctification of the Sabbath day, by thoſe religiouſe women.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Had their obſeruation of this Sabbath day, bene any thing but morall; or any thing leſſe then laudable, doubtleſſe the holy Ghoſt would haue paſſed by this point, and <hi>huried</hi> it in ſilence,

                        <p n="3">3. The Holy Ghoſt commendeth in theſe women, their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Sabbath day, moſt remarkablie in this, that he doth not relate it barely thus, <hi>they reſted the Sabbath day,</hi> but he further added the rule they did it by, &amp; that which warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their action, which was that they did it <hi>according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi> that is, the 4th commandement; <hi>And reſted the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, according to the commandement:</hi> Had this their fact bene the obſeruation of a ceremony &amp; a matter indifferent at that time, &amp; ſo not deſeruing ſpeciall notice &amp; commendation, in all liklihode, it had bene moſt fit to haue bene paſſed ouer in ſilence, or at the moſt to haue made a bare and ſparing relation of it, as to haue ſaid, they reſted the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> and added no more; but ſurely the addition of theſe words, <hi>according to the commandement</hi>

Ioh. 4. Gal, 1, 4. Luk. 1.6. Dan. 9.5. Ezra. 3.4. Ezra. 10.3.5. So much for profe of the Minor.</p>
                        <p>Happily ſome may ſay, that it mattereth not ſo much what theſe women did at that time, conſidering that they then knew not of the abolition of any ceremonies &amp;c. But for the auoiding of this, I doe build the weight of my argument (as you may ſee) not vpon the action of thoſe women, but vpon the allowance &amp; approbation of the ſame, by the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> now the Holy Ghoſt knew well enough, that all ceremonies were aboliſhed the day before this Sabbath was kept, Col. 2.14.</p>

                        <p>My 19th argument in defence of the Sabbath of the Lord, proueth that it muſt be morall; becauſe if you make it a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony &amp; aboliſhed, then you raſe out one of Gods Tenn com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, by making it but a <hi>tautologie</hi> and needleſſe repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, of what was commanded in other of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and thus I argue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That doctrine which teacheth and affirmeth ſuch things, as make one of Gods Tenn commandements, a tautologie &amp; needleſſe repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, of what is commanded in other of the ſame</hi> 10 <hi>commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that doctrine is falſe and erroniouſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But the doctrine which teacheth, that that ancient ordinance of Gods the old Sabbath day, is a ceremony &amp; aboliſhed, is that doctrine which maketh one of Gods</hi> 10 <hi>commandements &amp; by name the</hi> 4th <hi>com. a tautologie &amp; needleſſe repetition, of what is elſewhere commanded in other of the</hi> 10 <hi>commandements.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore the Doctrine which teacheth &amp; affirmeth, that that ancient ordinance of Gods the old Sabbath day, is a ceremony &amp; aboliſhed, is erroniouſe &amp; falſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the Major, none will deny it, ſince it were to ouerturne the number of Gods commandements which are <hi>Tenn,</hi> Deut. 10.4. &amp; to make things differing in number, one and the ſame in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; &amp; ſo make an horrible confuſion: yea, no man can indure to heare on it, that there ſhould be a tautologie in the Morall Law: I come therefore vnto the Minor, to ſhew, that they which hold the old Sabbath day to be a ceremony, they make one of Gods tenn command. &amp; by name the fourth, to be a tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, &amp; needleſſe repetition, of that which is commanded in other of the command: for this purpoſe we will conſider all the things commanded in the 4th com. &amp; then ſhew you, that if that time of the 7th day be a ceremony &amp; aboliſhed, then there is nothing left in the 4th com. but what is commanded in the other of the 10 commandements.</p>
                        <p>All the things then commanded in the 4th com. are three: the one is holy &amp; religiouſe exerciſes; the other is a reſt from labour; the third is the time wherein theſe are to be performed: as for the firſt of theſe, to wit, holy &amp; religiouſe exerciſes, as
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:21140:274"/>prayer, preaching, ſinging of Pſalmes, with the like, theſe being partes of Gods worſhip and furtherances thereof, are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ſecond Commandement: for the ſecond commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forbiddeth all falſe worſhip, &amp; commandeth the true worſhip of God, as prayer, preaching, Pſalmes, and Sacraments; as Diuines acknowledge: ſo then, we neede not rune to the 4th com. for theſe dueties of the Sabbath, to wit, holy exerciſes of prayer, ſinging of Pſalmes, preaching and reading of Gods word: for we haue them inioyned in the affirmatiue parte of the ſecond commandement: thus for the firſt point you ſee, that as touching the duetie of holy exerciſes, the 4th com. inioyneth nothing, but what was before inioyned in the 2th com. and ſo the 4th command. in thes reſpect is but a tautologie &amp; need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe repetition of what is elſe where commanded in other of the to commandements.</p>
                        <p>As for the ſecond thing inioyned in the 4th com. it is Reſt from laboures: now this duety, if you conſider it as a naturall Reſt, for the refreſhing of the body being toiled &amp; ſpent with laboures, then ſo it is inioyned in the ſixte commandement, in the affirmatiue parte thereof: but if you conſider it as a ſpirituall reſt, it being a vacancy from corporall laboures, that ſo way may be made for holy exerciſes; then ſo it is inioyned in the ſecond commandement alſo: for when the ſecond commandement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyneth Gods worſhip, it neceſſarily inferreth a reſt and ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from how ſhold and field workes; from merchandizing, buying and ſelling, that ſo men may be at liberty &amp; fredome to worſhip God: thus for the ſecond thing to wit, Reſt, you ſee the 4th co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. inioyneth nothing but what was before co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in the 2th com. &amp; therefore the 4th co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. in this point is but a tautologie and needleſſe repetition, of what is elſe where inioyned in other of the 10 commandements.</p>
                        <p>The third &amp; laſt thing is the time inioyned in the 4th com, which ſince they ſay it is aboliſhed, it followeth, that there is no time or day now in the 4th com. inioyned: touching which I thus argue, if the time to wit, that 7th day from the Creation, or the laſt day of the weeke, inioyned in the 4th com. be a Iewiſh Ceremony and aboliſhed, then is there no <hi>day</hi> inioyned
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:21140:274"/>now by the 4th commandement, for take from a Law the thing it inioyneth, &amp; then that Law inioyneth nothing: for example, thoſe anniuerſary and Ceremoniall Sabbaths mentioned in Leuit. 23. and aboliſhed by Coloſ. 2.17.18. when God aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thoſe very <hi>daies</hi> commanded in thoſe Lawes, he vtterly aboliſhed all daies, that were inioyned in thoſe commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: thoſe dayes being Ceremonies, when they were aboliſhed, not other daies came in the roome of them, by thoſe commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thers the ſame reaſon for the day and time in the 4th com. if it be ſuppoſed a Ceremony and aboliſhed: wherefore the old day being aboliſhed, and no new day inioyned by the 4th com. there is now nothing lefte in the 4th com. peculiar vnto it; nor can they ſhew vs any thing in it as now, which is not elſe where commanded in the Decalogue: thus you ſee, if you hold the old Sabbath day to be aboliſhed, then is this 4th commandement a tautologie, and needleſſe repetition of things before commanded.</p>
                        <p>Or, if you would ſuppoſe, that that particular time in the 4th com. is aboliſhed, but yet that <hi>a</hi> time or <hi>ſome</hi> time ſtill remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the 4th com. why ſtill it will come to the ſame: for a time, or ſome time; is inioyned in the 2th com. for where God requireth his worſhip, there it is neceſſarily inferred, that he there requireth a time or ſome time for his worſhip, without which it cannot be. Thus I haue proued it, that if you hold the old Sabbath day for an aboliſhed ceremony, then you raſe and deface the 4th com. by making it but <hi>a tautologie,</hi> and a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe repetition of ſuch things, as are commanded before in the 2th com. it remaineth therefore, that that doctrine which affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the old Sabbath day, to be a Iewiſh Ceremony, is falſe &amp; erroniouſe; the contrary whereto is the very trueth.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>If we aboliſh Saturday the old Sabbath day, which was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the</hi> 4th <hi>com. then we leaue no day as commanded now by the</hi> 4th <hi>com.</hi>

                        <p> 
                           <hi>But we muſt leaue a day, as commanded now by the</hi> 4th <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore we muſt not aboliſh Saturday the old Sabbath day.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the Minor, it is confeſſed by all, that there is a <hi>day</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded now by the 4th com. &amp; therefore I paſſe that point as granted; and ſo come vnto the Major, the conſequence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I proue to be ſound, by an Induction of particulares, of which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>here is one and the ſame reaſon.</p>
                        <p>Firſt for their <hi>new-moones,</hi> which God commanded the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites Numb. 28.11. wherein they were on euery firſt <hi>day</hi> of the moneth, to reſt from laboures Amos. 8.5. And to repaire vnto the Miniſter for inſtruction ij King. 4.23. Now when God aboliſhed by the text Col. 2.16.17. that very day commanded in that Law Numb. 28.11. then hee left no <hi>day</hi> as commanded ſtill by that law Numb. 28.11. In the next place, come we vnto all thoſe anniuerſary Sabbaths commanded in the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law: the Iſraelites had one Sabbath, on the firſt day of the 7th moneth Leuit. 23.24. againe, the Iſraelites had two other Sabbaths in the 7th moneth, as we reade Leuit. 23.39. beſides diuers other Sabbaths there mentioned in Leuit. 23. Now when by this text Col. 2.16.17. euery of thoſe <hi>daies,</hi> commanded in thoſe lawes, were aboliſhed, there were no <hi>daies</hi> left as commanded ſtill by thoſe commandements in Leuit. 23. Now there is the ſame reaſon of the day commanded in the 4th com. if you hold it a Ceremony, as there was of thoſe other dayes which were Ceremonies Leuit. 23. for as the time in theſe anniuerſary lawes, was a Ceremony, ſo my aduerſaries hold the time in this 4th com. is a Ceremony; wherefore there is the ſame reaſon in all; that is, aboliſh that ſpeciall time ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in any of theſe commandements, and you leaue no day as commanded in theſe lawes &amp; commandements.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I proue it from all thoſe textes which are vſually brought againſt the Lords Sabbaths, as Exod. 31.13. Col. 2.16.17. Rom. 14.5. &amp; Gal. 4.10. In which texts, our Anti-Sabbatha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians or enemies to Gods Sabbaths, ſay, that the Sabbath <hi>day</hi> of the Iewes, commanded in the 4th com. is aboliſhed as a <hi>ſigne</hi> and <hi>ſhaddow &amp;c.</hi> And that text of <hi>eſteeming one day aboue an other</hi>
                           <pb n="515" facs="tcp:21140:275"/>Rom. 14.5. And that text alſo reprouing the Galatianes ſo <hi>obſeruing of daies</hi> Gal. 4.10. are ſpoken againſt that <hi>day</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the 4th com. wherefore ſince the word (day) is of as larg an extent in theſe texts, as the ſame word (day) is of in the 4th commandement it is as cleere as the ſunne at noone day, that if that day, commanded in the 4th com. be an aboliſhed Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, then is there now no day commanded by the 4th com. and if the obſeruation of thoſe <hi>daies,</hi> commanded in the 4th com. be reprouable, and aboliſhed by Gal. 4.10. &amp;c. Then are there no dayes now in vſe by virtue of the 4th com. the reaſon is, becauſe thoſe dayes which were commanded are aboliſhed, as they ſay.</p>
                        <p>It is more then manifeſt then, that if we aboliſh Saturday the old Sabbath day, once commanded in the 4th com. then we leaue no day as commanded now by the 4th com. we muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cleaue vnto Saturday which God hath ſanctified &amp; hallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed Geneſ. 2.2.3. or elſe bid farewell vnto all <hi>daies,</hi> &amp; Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, as diuinly inſtituted.</p>

                        <p>My 21th argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the defence of Gods Sabbath proueth, that it muſt be morall &amp; ſtill in force, or elſe we mancle &amp; lame the <hi>royall Law</hi> of Gods commandements, receiuing &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging but but ſome parceles &amp; peeces thereof onely: &amp; doe deny that intire and whole Law of God, to be <hi>whole</hi> &amp; <hi>intire</hi> to vs, or to belong vnto vs in the <hi>Jntegrity</hi> &amp; <hi>perfection</hi> thereof.

                           <hi>Therefore no man may aboliſh the 7th day Saturday Sabbath, commanded in the Law of Gods</hi> 10 <hi>commandements.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the conſequence of the Major: becauſe this argument fetcheth all its force, from the <hi>wholneſse</hi> &amp; <hi>Integrity</hi> of the law, it is needfull therefore that I ſhew, what the wholneſſe &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Law is: note therefore, that the Law is then ſaid to be whole, intire, &amp; perfect, when it hath all the partes and percelles added to it, which God at the making of it, put and ioyned together, lacking none of them: like vs we cale him an whole an perfect man, who <hi>hath</hi> all his ioyntes &amp; partes which God gaue him when he made him: &amp; as we cale that an whole and perfect Bible, which <hi>hath</hi> in it, both the old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, together with all and euery of the ſeuerall bookes &amp; Chapters bound together, which at the firſt God ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and as that man is ſaid to be an whole and perfect man, who <hi>lacketh</hi> no limme or ioynt, of thoſe which God ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he made him: &amp; as that is ſaid to be an whole &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Bible, which <hi>lacketh</hi> neither Chapter nor verſe of all thoſe Chapters &amp; verſes, which God deliuered in writing, from the Prophets and Apoſtles; ſo that is ſaid to be the whole intire, &amp; perfect Law of God which <hi>hath</hi> all the partes and things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, which at firſt belonged to it, &amp; which <hi>lacketh</hi> none of all thoſe precepts, which at the making and diuulging of that Law, God ioyned together. If then we would know, whither we haue the whole law of God intirly now or not we muſt haue recourſe vnto the making &amp; firſt diuulging of this Law: looke therefore into the twentyth Chapter of Exodus, and there you ſhall ſee this whole and intire Law of God, with all &amp; euery the members thereof, as God made it when he firſt proclaimed it vnto his Church: thus you ſee both what the wolneſſe &amp; inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of Gods Law is, and where to find it whole and intire as God made it; &amp; if any man ſhall diminiſh or deny, any one particle commanded in this Law, he muſt be ſaid to mancle &amp; lame this Law: &amp; the Law muſt be accounted but a lame, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled &amp; imperfect Law, like as if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lacketh but a ioynte of his hand or a finger, he is ſaid to be a lame man; and if a Bible wanteth but a leafe or a verſe, it is an imperfect Bible.</p>
                        <pb n="517" facs="tcp:21140:276"/>
                        <p> Now to apply this; Jn the Decalogue, God chargeth his people, to <hi>Remember</hi> the Sabbath day, and to <hi>ſanctify</hi> the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and to <hi>Rest</hi> on the 7th day; now this day caled Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, &amp; 7th day, was our Saturday, as all men know: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any man will aboliſh this Saturday 7th day Sabbath, as not commanded now to be <hi>remembred,</hi> now to be <hi>ſanctified,</hi> and now to be <hi>reſted on,</hi> that man, doth mancle &amp; lame the <hi>royall law</hi> of God: for he withholdeth one branch of Gods Law, which inioyneth the remembrance and ſanctification of the Saturday 7th day Sabbath, that man, receiueth and obeyeth but ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celes &amp; peeces of Gods Law onely: for he yeeldeth obedience but onely vnto ſome <hi>nyne,</hi> or nyne &amp; an <hi>halfe</hi> of Gods <hi>tenn</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; for he leaueth out that peece and parte which concerneth the Saturday Sabbath: and that man, muſt deny Gods intire &amp; whole law, to be intire &amp; whole vnto vs; or, to belong vnto vs, in the integrity &amp; perfection thereof: for if the Law belonged vnto vs, in its integrity and perfection, then the Saturday Sabbath, which was once commanded in that Law, &amp; ſo was a parte &amp; a peece of the Law, it muſt now alſo be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Law, and ſo belong vnto vs now. Thus the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is proued good, that whoſoeuer aboliſheth the old Sabbath day, he mancleth Gods Law, he yeeldeth obedience but vnto percels and peeces of it, &amp; he denyeth that Gods Law belongeth vnto vs, in its <hi>intigrity</hi> &amp; <hi>perfection.</hi> For the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath, ſerueth to make vp Gods Law, an intire, an whole, &amp; a perfect Law; &amp; without it, it is but a lame, imperfect, mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, defectiue Law; like a lame man wanting an hand, or a finger of his hand; &amp; like an imperfect &amp; defectiue Bible, lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Chapter, or a verſe of ſome Chapter.</p>
                        <p>I confeſſe that thoſe tene Miniſters, Gods aduerſaries and myne in this point, goe aboute like botching Taylers, or ſowter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Coblers (for I cannot more aptly and fitly reſemble their action) to make vp this breach againe, by adding a peece of new cloth to fill vp the rent, and ſo they ſuppoſe to auoide this blow, and to make vp the Law againe an intire and perfect law: now howeuer it is commendable to peece &amp; mend old gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet it is altogether inſufferable, for any to play the
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:21140:277"/>botch er and cobler with Gods lawes: the new peece wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they would fill vp this rent, &amp; make vp this breach, it is the <hi>Lords day</hi> or firſt day of the weeke, &amp; this day muſt now be thought &amp; firmely beleeued, to be put into the old Law of the Decalogue, &amp; then we ſhall haue 10 commandements againe wholly &amp; compleatly: but as once it was vnlawfull to weare a garment of Linſey wolſey, and to bring profane and common perſones into the Temple, ſo is it now, to mingle <hi>humane</hi> inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones with <hi>Diuine</hi> ordinances, and to bring a day appointed by man, into the Morall, eternall, and ſacred Law of God: for the Lords day hath no higher inſtitution then the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Church; and will they peece and mend vp the Diuine Law of God, with the peece of an humane ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? but admit that the Lords day were of Diuine ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet is this peece too bigg or too little, to ſtand in the breach of the 4th commandement, as formerly I haue ſhowne, becauſe it cannot agree to the 4th com. beſides, to ſee the vnskilfulneſſe of theſe peecers; they confeſſe that this Lords day Sabbath is a new ordinance, pertaining to the new Teſtament, as are <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme</hi> &amp; the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> &amp; yet they will attempt to mende vp the breach of the old Law, with a peece taken out of the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: thus the old law, ſhall be partly old, partly new; partly Law, &amp; partly Goſpell; a new kind of botching. They ſaied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Cobler ſhould anſwer my booke, and ſee now if they be not as good as their word; is not this worke of theirs Coblers worke?</p>
                        <p>Hauing proued the Major, I come vnto the Minor, &amp; here I am to proue, that no man may ſo wreſt the Scriptures, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to <hi>mancle</hi> &amp; <hi>lame</hi> the <hi>Royall Law</hi> of God, no man may receiue &amp; obey but ſome <hi>percels</hi> &amp; <hi>peeces</hi> of it onely; &amp; that no man may deny the <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>intire</hi> Law of God, to belong to vs <hi>wholly, fully,</hi> and in the <hi>integritie</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> thereof: me thinke none ſhould deny this Minor; if any will. 1. He is guilty of doeing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, to the Law, and of being partiall in Gods Lawes, this was the ſinne of thoſe Prieſts laied to their charge by God, who had <hi>polluted the Sanctuary, &amp; done violence to the Law,</hi> Zeph. 3.4. and againe, <hi>yee haue not kept my waies, but haue bene

                        <p n="2">2. I finde it in <hi>Polanus</hi> Syntag: pag. 353. that Papiſts doe deny the ſecond Commandement againſt worſhiping of Jma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to be <hi>Morall</hi> and appertaine vnto <hi>Chriſtianes:</hi> to the like purpoſe I find in <hi>Willet</hi> on Exod. 20. pag. 342. 343. theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <hi>The commandement (ſay Papists) of aboliſhing and deſtroying Images, was ceremoniall, &amp; therefore it concerneth not Chriſtians now.</hi> And againe, <hi>The ſecond praecept against the making of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges was onely temporall, &amp; concerned the Iewes.</hi> Thus Papiſts are partiall in the Law, and deny its integrity: now if we may deny the Integrity of the Law, tell me why Papiſts may not doe ſo too?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If any will deny this Minor by the iudgement of M. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> he denieth himſelfe to be <hi>regenerated:</hi> ſee M. <hi>Perkins</hi> in his Commentary on the Galatians, Chap. 5. v. 4. pag. 311. where treateing of the <hi>Law,</hi> thus he writeth, <hi>The Law it is wholly copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: all the partes of it are linked one to an other: he that is bound to one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, is bound to all: he that keepes one indeede, keepes all: he that breakes one, in reſpect of the diſpoſition of his heart, is a breaker of all, Iam.</hi> 2.10. <hi>he that makes no conſcience to keepe ſome one commandement, if occaſion be offred, will breake any: Hence it followes, that true regeneration is that which is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation &amp; chang, according to the whole Law of God: Ioſias turned to God according to the whole Law. Zacharie &amp; Eliſabeth, walked in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God.

                        <p>To conclud, we muſt either reaſſume and reedify Gods ancient

That day of the weeke, and that onely is the Sabbath by the 4th com. whoſe proper name is <hi>Sabbath day</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the <hi>Sabbath day</hi> Exod. 20.8, now no day of the weeke was euer called Sabbath day by the Scriptures, or ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but Saturday: &amp; therefore no day but Saturday can ſtand by the 4th com.

Onely that day is Sabbath day by the 4th com. which is the 7th day of the weeke.

Thus you ſee, none other day of the weeke can be Sabbath by the 4th com. becauſe none other day was euer caled Sabbath day, nor counted the 7th day. 4.

And thus I argue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That which is expreſsely commanded in the morall Law, which by experience we find, tending vnto, and a notable furtherance of Gods publique &amp; priuate worſhip and ſeruice; and of all ſortes of people, for their attainment and increaſe of grace &amp; godlineſse, and growing vp in our Chriſtian Religion: yea and further, which is commanded as a worke of mercy vnto mankind; yea both to man &amp; beast; that thing is morall &amp; perpetuall, &amp; ſtill in force.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>But to reſt from worke on Saturday the 7th day, is expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Morall</hi> Law, <hi>and we find it by experience tending vnto, &amp; a notable furtherance of Gods publique &amp; priuate worſhip &amp; ſeruice; &amp; of all ſortes of people, for their attainment &amp; increaſe of grace &amp; godlineſſe, and growing vp in our Chriſtian Religion: yea and further, which is commanded as a worke of mercy vnto mankind; yea both to man and beast.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore to rest from worke, on Saturday the 7th day, is morall perpetuall and ſtill in force.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the trueth of the Major, I ſuppoſe none will deny it: for it is a Rule in expounding the commandements, that not onely the things expreſſed in the Decalogue are commanded as dueties binding vs, but alſo all <hi>cauſes, helpes, &amp; furtherances</hi> vnto thoſe dueties: whence I reaſon thus, if the helpes &amp; furtherances of morall dueties belong vnto vs, though not expreſſed in the Law, then by like if not by ſtronger reaſon, ſuch helpes &amp; furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:21140:280"/>as ſerue vnto morall dueties, being expreſly commanded in the Law, doe belong vnto vs &amp; bind vs as morall: yea further, that duety which is commanded in the law, as a worke of mercy, that muſt needs be morall without all controuerſy.</p>
                        <p>And as for the Minor, I ſuppoſe it is as cleere as the Major: for, 1. it is expreſly commanded in the Morall Law, that we ſhould reſt from worke on the 7th day, which is Saturday. <hi>But the 7th day is the Sabbath &amp;c. in it thou ſhalt not doe any worke &amp;c.</hi> Exod. 20.10.

The trueth hereof we ſee by our now keeping of the <hi>Lords day;</hi> for our reſting from worldly imployments on this day, doth greatly further the worſhip of God, &amp; all holy exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; iuſt ſo it would be with the 7th day if we had it in vſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That a reſt from worke on the 7th day, is commanded as a worke of mercy, is plaine Exod. 23.12. <hi>In the 7th day, thou ſhalt reſt, that thine oxe and thine Aſſe may rest, and the ſonne of thy maide, and the ſtranger may be refreſhed.</hi> See to this effect alſo Deut. 5.14. So then God would that men ſhould reſt on the 7th day, for the reliefe eaſe and refreſhment, both of man and beaſt: God would that Maſters ſhould exerciſe pittie and mercy to their wearied and tired ſeruants, by reſting them on the 7th day. Now in this reſpect, I may cale the Saturday or Sabbath day, the Seruants <hi>Iubile;</hi> for on this day euery weeke, they ſhould haue releaſe from their painfull and ſeruile laboures, to refreſh themſelues therin: on this day all Maſters ſhould exerciſe mercy to their wearied ſeruants: how euer other times &amp; holy dayes for ſeruants refreſhment, are at the liberty &amp; pleſure of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet this time &amp; day, is not ſo: for of duety God in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of Seruants requireth it of Maſters, &amp; ſo it is the Seruants by right from God. Thus you ſee it cleere, that to reſt on the

                        <p>In a word, the obſeruation of the Sabbath day, muſt needs be a thing greatly tending to the good of mankind: becauſe it was made for them: <hi>The Sabbath was made for man.</hi> Mark. 2.27. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe therefore we will accuſe God of vnskilfulneſſe, in making things for men, which are not good and proffitable for them, we muſt needs yeeld, that the obſeruation of the Sabbath, is a thing tending vnto, and a furtherance of mans good in generall,</p>
                        <p>What anſwer may be framed to this argument I cannot fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, vnleſſe it be ſome ſuch as this, that the reſt from labour is it onely which tendeth vnto piety, and is a worke of mercy, but not the day, to wit, the 7th day, this helpeth not &amp;c.

                        <p n="1">1. The day helpeth vnto a religiouſe ſanctification of the reſt; becauſe it is a <hi>ſacred day</hi> aboue all others in the weeke, for God hallowed it at the creation, and it onely, Geneſ. 2.3. &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth beſt beſuite ſacred actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; addeth a kind of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reſpect vnto them: thus a man is touched with a more ſublime and honourable regard of the duety of prayer, in the Church (as of ancient in the Temple) then in a common houſe: ſee Geneſ. 28.16.17. Eccleſ. 4.17. Leuit, 19.30. ij. Chron. 8.11. Mark. 11.15.16.17. And Moſes muſt <hi>put off his ſhoes,</hi> becauſe the <hi>place</hi> was <hi>Holy grownd,</hi> Exod. 3.5.

                        <p n="2">2. One duety of the Sabbath, is to ſing Pſalmes, vnto the praiſe of God, as we may ſee by the title of the 92 Pſalme: and among other things the Church doth praiſe God, for that his marvailouſe &amp; miraculouſe worke of the Creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, whereof the Sabbath day or 7th day is a ſigne, Exod. 31.17.15.

The 7th day being that day whereon God himſelfe reſted at the Creation Geneſ. 2.2, this day hath a force in it aboue all daies in the weeke, to perſwad men to reſt themſelues, and giue reſt vnto their ſeruants on that day, in an imitation of God, becauſe God reſted on it: and thus it furthereth. 1. The work of mercy, in afording reſt vnto poore ſeruants: and 2. It furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the workes of piety &amp; religion: for the more freely that men reſt, the more cheerefully they worſhip God: this efficacy no other day hath.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. As a place, ſo the time of the 7th day, is a furtherance to Gods worſhip; for thereby we haue time to ſerue God in, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which God cannot be ſerued; yea further, this time &amp; day doth further the continuance and frequency of Gods worſhip: for were it not for this, ſome men would thinke it enough to giue God but one howre or two in a day, and one day in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth or quarter of a yeere.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The time and day, was commanded at once together with the duety of reſt, both in one commandement, both in one ſentence in that commandement, both with one breath, Exod. 20.10.

                        <p>Thus I haue proued it, that the obſeruation of Saturday the 7th day, is morall &amp; perpetuall: becauſe it tendeth vnto the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of Gods publike (as well as priuate) wor hip and ſeruice; &amp; becauſe it is a worke of mercy, both to man &amp; beaſt: now all workes in the Decalogue, tending to promote Gods ſeruice, are Morall; and all workes therein commanded, which are vvorkes of Mercy, are Morall alſo, by the judgement of all Diuines: and ſo much for this anſwer.</p>

                        <p>As touching the profe of the major, if any ſhall except againſt it, ſaying, they could like of it, if it ſpake of ſuch a duety in the Decalogue, as were firſt found out by the light of nature; but miſlike of it, becauſe it ſpeakes of ſuch a duety as is firſt found out by a ſupernaturall light, &amp; then made knowne vnto a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man. Hereto I reply, that it is not matteriall whither the duety be firſt found out by the light of nature, &amp; after allowed of by the ſame light, or firſt found out by the ſupernaturall light of Gods word in his 4th com. &amp; then ſubſcribed vnto by the light of nature: it mattereth not I ſay which way &amp; by whom the duety was found out firſt, ſo long as nature &amp; the light of reaſon doth allow of it, iuſtify it, and ſubſcrib vnto it, after it is found out: for, men are as well bound by the Law and light of

<pb n="533" facs="tcp:21140:284"/>in vſe, the common weale could haue nothing againſt it to oppoſe it, but muſt allow of it, approue it, and ſubſcrib vnto it as good to be obſerued: becauſe in it and by it, a good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite cometh vnto the common weale, both for their bodies and ſoules.</p>
                        <p>In a word, doth not nature teach vs, that it is meete to ſhew mercy vnto Seruants, and allow them one day in 7 to reſt in from their painefull laboures, and to refreſh themſelues? and ſo to fit them for labour againe on the next Sixe daies? and doth not nature teach, that it is fitter that this day ſhould be of Gods choiſe, which is Saturday the 7th day, then of mans choiſe? and alſo, that the time ſhould not be indifferent, at mans pleſure, leaſt ſome cruell Maſters ſhould deny their Seruants this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary refreſhment, but neceſſary, as inioyned by God &amp; as a duety from all Maſters?</p>
                        <p>How then ſhould this Sabbath be but morall, when the light of nature cannot except againſt it? and how ſhould it not but be obſerued of vs to this day, when that naturall light of reaſon that is in vs, doth conſent vnto it, &amp; allow and approue of it as good for vs? as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Doth not nature teach you, that if a man hath long haire, it is a ſhame vnto him?</hi> 1.

So may I ſay, doth not nature teach vs, that if we had Gods ancient Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, the obſeruation of them would proue both piouſe and commodiouſe? our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>The Sabbath was made for man.</hi> Mark. 2.27.

                        <p n="2">2.

                        <p n="4">4. The abſurdety of this diſtinction yet appeareth in this alſo; for ſince there was neuer any day of the weeke, weekly caled Sabbath day, in all the Scriptures, but the Saturday onely, how can any man in his right wittes, apply the 4th com. to any day but Saturday? it is as abſurd, as if one ſhould ſuppoſe two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdayes

I confeſſe we cale now a daies Sunday, Sabbath day, but what matters it what we cale, who take liberty to cale, and to miſcale daies at our pleſure? but I ſpeake of a Diuine nomination of daies, vſed in the Scriptures; for neither <hi>Prophets</hi> nor <hi>Apostles</hi> did euer cale the Sunday, or Lords day, Sabbath day, nor any other day of the weeke ſaue Saturday.

                        <p>A ſecond euaſion I will touch, and it is there diſtinction of a 7th day, and the 7th day: let a man vrge thoſe words of the 4th com. <hi>But the 7th day is the Sabbath of the Lord &amp;c.</hi> to proue that we muſt ſanctify the old Sabbath day which is the 7th day, and they will make this for one of their anſwers, that the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpeakes of <hi>a</hi> 7th day not of <hi>the</hi> 7th day: by a 7th day, they vnderſtand ſome day or other of the weeke, at rouers and at randome, but not any one certaine day of the weeke. Were there nothing elſe againſt this diſtinction, this one were enough, that
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:21140:287"/>by refuſing <hi>the</hi> 7th day which implieth a ſetled, well knowne, &amp; certaine day of the weeke, to imbrace <hi>a</hi> 7th day, at rouers, as an vncertaine time, hereby they labour to make things knowne when, vnknowne when, things certaine to be vncertaine: as if they delighted in vncertainties; and as if God ſhould require a time for his worſhip, but no man knew when.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Were this anſwer tollerable, what ſhould ſtand firme in the Scriptures? God commanded circumciſion on the 8th day, had ſome of our times liued in thoſe times, they could by this Law, haue circumciſed a child on the 9th or 10th day, &amp; made it in their accompt a 8th day, though not the 8th day: for if they would but skip ouer the firſt or ſecond day of the childs birth, not rekoning them, then the 9th day or 10th day, would be a 8th day. The Lord commanded the Paſſeouer to be eaten on the 14th day of the moneth: loe we haue ſome, by a new deuiſed computation, could haue iuſtified it, that by the ſame Law, they might haue eaten the Paſſeouer on the 15th or 16th day of the moneth, and all well enough: for they could make the 15th or 16th day of the moneth an 14th day though not the 14th day: for hauing ſaid, that the commandement may be vnderſtod of a 14th day, they can thus make it good; they will not rekone the firſt day of the moneth for any of the number, but begine their account at the ſecond day, and ſo the 15th day will become <hi>a</hi> 14th day, is not this pretty iugling? think you that theſe men thinke they haue to doe with a God, when they thus expound his commandements? or with ſome babe or child that cannot tell to 7 or to 14? but they will ſay perhapes, they doe not ſo rekone nor skip ouer daies &amp;c. But that this is falſe, I thus proue it: our Sunday, or Lords day is not onely the firſt day of the weeke, in our common account; and in the computation of all Chruches Iewes and Chriſtianes, Proteſtants and Papiſtes; but alſo it is caled the firſt day of the weeke, conſtantly in the Scriptures, ſee Mat. 28.1. Mark. 16.2. Luk. 24.1. Ioh. 20.1.19. Act. 20.7. ij. Cor. 16.2. Now that our new Sabbatharia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, might make their Lords day Sabbath, to become <hi>a</hi> 7th day, &amp; ſo accord to the 4th com. they muſt skip ouer <hi>Sunday</hi> in their accompt, not rekoning it for the firſt day of the number, &amp; ſo begine their rekoning at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
                           <pb n="540" facs="tcp:21140:288"/>counting Monday for the firſt day of the weeke, &amp; then the Sunday or Lords day following will be a 7th day: thus by their diſtinction &amp; cuning iugling together, that day which our Church &amp; all Churches cales <hi>dies octavus</hi> the 8th day, theſe haue made it a 7th day: &amp; that day which the Scriptures cale, the <hi>firſt</hi> day, the ſame they haue made a 7th day.</p>
                        <p>I abhorr with my heart &amp; ſoule, to ſee Gods people thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, and his ſacred Scripture, I meane his 4th com. thus abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and made a noſe of waxe to be turned hither and thither as the times pleaſe. I know ſome are redy to wiſh I had ſpent my time better, then to haue medled in this point of the Sabbath, ſo in loue they are with their wonted erroures: and others, haue wiſhed me and my booke hanged vp together, with the like, ſo raſh is their furiouſe zeale for their new Sabbath, and ſo madd they are and enraged againſt me for diſcouering this their abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable abuſe, both of Gods people and the ſacred Scriptures: but whither I haue done well or euill in this point, and whither they or I doe rather deſerue this cenſure, I leaue to the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and vnpartiall reader.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. An other abſurdety againſt this diſtinction is, that if a 7th day may be vnderſtod in the 4th commandement indefinitly &amp; vncertainly, then were not the Iewes tied to ſanctify the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath, no more then any other day in the weeke.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. All Tranſlatores both new and old, are againſt them: for they conſtantly tranſlate it <hi>the</hi> 7th day, as the moſt fit, not <hi>a</hi> 7th day.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Since there is no more 7th daies, then there is Saturdaies in a weeke, it is a fooliſh diſtinction to talke of a 7th day, as if there were or could be more 7th daies in a weeke then one: for ſince our Sunday or Lords day, is the <hi>firſt</hi> day, in a Diuine account, as hath bene proued, and alſo in all other approued computationes, therefore Saturday following, and onely Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day muſt be both the 7th day, and a 7th day without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. That it muſt be tranſlated, and alſo expounded of the 7th day, to wit, Saturday, and not of a 7th day vncertainly which day, I haue proued it in my Expoſition of theſe words of the
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:21140:288"/>4th com. <hi>But the</hi> 7th <hi>day is the Sabbath of the Lord &amp;c.</hi> Vnto which place I referre my reader.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The abſurdety of this diſtinction appeareth thus: if the word ſeauenth, may be tranſlated <hi>a</hi> 7th, as of a day vncertaine, then one and the ſame word, in one and the ſame commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould haue diuerſe ſenſes: for the word ſeauenth, at the latter end of the commandement Exod. 20.11. muſt be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated <hi>the</hi> 7th, as of a day certaine: for God reſted <hi>the</hi> 7th day, to wit, on Saturday Geneſ. 2.3. it is abſurd therefore to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the word ſeauenth, in the former parte of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Exod. 20.10. <hi>a</hi> 7th, as a day vncertaine. And ſo much for this diſtinction.</p>

                        <p>A third euaſion they haue, &amp; this is very frequent in all mens mouthes, let a man vrge the 4th com. for the Saturday Sabbath, &amp; your anſwer ſhall be this, <hi>One of Seauen,</hi> the 4th com. it inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth one day of 7, ſo they reiect the 7th day, and will haue one of 7. Thus they leane vpon this falſe expoſition of the com. that by the 7th day, is to be vnſterſtod one day of the 7: by one of 7 they meane any one of the 7, or <hi>ſome one day of the</hi> 7 or other with out difference. Thus theſe enemies to Gods Sabbath, doe corrupt the proper ſenſe of the ſcriptures, rather then they will ſee their old erroures, and be take them to a reformation; glad they are if they can inuent any thing, for the ſubuerſion of this ſacred ordinance Gods Sabbath day.</p>
                        <p>My firſt argument againſt this euaſion ſhall be this, that the word Seauenth vſed in the 4th com. it is not a <hi>Cardinall</hi> as they cale it, but an <hi>Ordinall</hi> word of number; it noteth but one of that number, and its order alſo, as that it is the laſt for order of that number named; thus the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th, is not any one of the 10, but the laſt for order of the 10. The fowrth moneth of the yeere, it is not any one moneth of the 4, but the laſt moneth of the 4, ſo the Seauenth day of the weeke, it is not any day of the 7, but the laſt for order of all the 7. they doe therefore moſt ſhamefully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the word of God, who when they heare God ſay, <hi>But the</hi> 7th <hi>day is the Sabbath of the Lord,</hi> which 7th is the laſt day of the number or weeke, then they will come in with their deuices
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:21140:289"/>to defeate God of his day and time, ſaying, by the 7th, may be meante one of 7, or, ſome one day of the 7, that is, as well the firſt day of the weeke, or any other, as the laſt day.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The abſurdety of this anſwer and expoſition, may appeare by the like caſes: The paſſeouer was by the Law to be eaten vpon the 14th day of the moneth; now according to theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiters of Gods Law, a man might haue eaten the paſſouer vpon one of the 14 daies, as on the 5th or 8th or 12th daie, and iuſtifiably too; for their Expoſition of Gods law is, by 14th to vnderſtand one of 14, or, ſome one day of the 14, that is, any one day of the 14. Againe, they were to circumciſe a child on the 8th day, I, ſay theſe men, that is, vpon one or vpon ſome one of the 8 daies: ſo they might at their choiſe, circumciſe a child on the 4th or 6th day of its age: thus by their expoſititiones they make Gods Lawes of none effect: for God made choiſe of one certaine day aboue all others, and theſe haue made all daies common; God would haue the 7th day which is the laſt of the 7 for his Sabbath, but theſe tell vs, one of 7, ſome one of 7, or any one of the 7 may ſuffice; as if God had not made his choiſe of the day, but left vs the prerogatiue, to make the choiſe: good Lord deliuer vs from ſuch Expoſiters, and ſuch Expoſitiones. I could haue borne this griefe with ſilence, as a long time I did if theſe Antiſabbatharians, or enemies to Gods Sabbaths, would haue taken knowledge of theſe their erroures, in loue and the ſpirit of meekneſſe, either in priuate before I printed my former booke, or in publike by my former booke; but now they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with an high hand, vtterly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning me, &amp; proteſting againſt me both in publike and in priuate, wherefore I doe the world to know, how I abhorre theſe their vngodly proceedings in abuſing Gods people, and in corruption the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If by the 7th day, may be vnderſtod, one of 7 indifferently, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might the Iewes haue kept any one day in the weeke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difference for their Sabbath, as Sunday, Monday, or ſome other, but this is abſurd to imagine: yea a greater abſurdety; for ſince all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, that the Iewes, with their Prophets &amp; <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, vnderſtod by the words Sabbath day, one certaine day
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:21140:289"/>of the weeke, as Saturday, if now we will expound the ſame words in the 4th com. of a day vncertaine, then ſhall the words of ſcripture chang their ſenſe as the times cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: the ſame words for 2000. yeeres ſhall ſignifie one thing, and euer after that, an other thing: oh manſtrouſe abſurdety!</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If by the 7th day, may be vnderſtod ſome one day of the 7 without difference, then may we Chriſtianes, keepe the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath againe with the Iewes: for this is one day of the 7: but this they hold a fowle errour, to keepe the Iewes Sabbath; &amp; therefore by the 7th day, we muſt not vnderſtand one day of the 7 indifferently.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If by the 7th day in the 4th com. be vnderſtod, one day of 7, then is there no ceremony in the 4th com. for, if one of 7 be the true expoſition of the 4th com. it was euer the true ſenſe of it; &amp; if one of 7 indifferently, both was &amp; now is, the true expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Com. where I pray is the ceremony? where is the time which we ſay was aboliſhed by Chriſt? ſince the ſenſe of the com. is euery way the ſame now which it was: But our new Sabbatharians all ſay, there is a ceremony in the time: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not one of 7, the true ſenſe &amp; expoſition of the 7th day, in the 4th com.</p>

<pb n="547" facs="tcp:21140:291"/>made by God to the creature, must ſtand in force, till he reuerſe it, which yet he hath not done.</hi> Thus M. Perkins doth expreſly affirme it, that this reaſon annexed to the 4th commandement is ſtill in force.</p>
                        <p>In a word, I might be infinite in alleaging Authores this way: for what writer but holdeth theſe latter words of the Com. to be ſtill in force? as appeareth in that in theire Expoſitions on the 4th com. they vnderſtand by theſe words, <hi>the 7th day is the Sabbath,</hi> one day of 7 to be meant &amp; to be morall: but M. Greenwod will be contrary to all Authores, rather then God ſhall haue his Sabbaths againe.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. If onely thoſe firſt words of the commandement, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> be morall; then is the 4th com. vtterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed: for they alleage theſe texts Exod. 31.15.16. &amp; Col. 2.16. where is mention made expreſly of the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of the <hi>Sabbath day</hi> in the 4th com. as a ſigne and ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: wherefore, ſince by theſe textes, they aboliſh the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Sabbath day, mentioned in the begining of the 4th commandement it muſt nedes follow, that thoſe words in the begininge of the com. Remember the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed: and ſo, if no other words be morall in the 4th com. but thoſe, then are none at all morall, but all aboliſhed.</p>
                        <p>Now whereas ſome ſay, all but the firſt words of the com. are <hi>Application:</hi> it is more likely, that they are <hi>Explication:</hi> now they will not reiect (J truſt) the Explication of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. to ſay they are application, it doth imply, that the words <hi>Sabbath day</hi> in the begining of the commandement are certaine generall words, which may be applied vnto any day, and ſo the latter parte of the commandement ſhould apply them to the 7th day: but their foundation is ſandy, for they cannot ſhew where at any time, theſe words in the 4th commandement Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, were taken generally, or for any other day then Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 7th day. 3. Since that theſe words (Sabbath day) at the begining of the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; theſe (the 7th day is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath) towards the end of the commandement, are promiſcuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly vſed in Scripture, the one for the other, as hath bene proued, it is abſurd to ſuppoſe the one of theſe to be the Application of
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:21140:292"/>the other 4. Since that we are commanded to ſanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day Exod. 20.8. and, probibited to worke on the 7th day Exod. 20.10. It is abſurd to ſay, that this latter is an Application of the former: is it not rather an <hi>Addition,</hi> and that of one parte of the commandement to an other? <hi>5.</hi> If the after partes of the commandement be but Application and belonge not to vs; why then doe all Diuines out of theſe after partes of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement determine, that one day in 7 is morall?</p>
                        <p>And whereas ſome ſay that all the latter words of the com. are appurtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces to the com. I reply, if they be but ſuch appurrena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces as may ſafely be ſeuered from the com. then 1. we haue no neede now as thoſe Iewes had, of Gods <hi>inſample</hi> &amp; <hi>reaſon</hi> mentioned in the 4th commandement Exod. 20.11. to moue vs to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Sabbath day. 2. Then need we not giue God a Sabbath once in 7 daies, or once in 700 daies &amp;c. 3. Then doe we abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Gods expreſſe prohibition, of doeing ſeruile workes on the Sabbuth day Exod. 20.10. fourthly then why haue Diuines and Expoſiters, affirmed that, one day of 7 is morall, out of theſe words, <hi>the 7th day is the Sabbath? 5.</hi> that theſe words, (the 7th day is the Sabbath) are no appurtenances, but of higher nature, I haue proued in my 5th argument in defence of the Lords Sabbaths, where I proued, that theſe words are a <hi>parte</hi> of the 4th com. and ſo cannot be ſeuered from the commandement as appurtenances may be.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, there is a Tradition among vs, that theſe words (the 7th day is the Sabbath &amp;c. in it, thou ſhalt doe no worke) is but Application, and Appurtenances. Of this I may ſay, as Chriſt ſaied, <hi>ye haue made the commandement of none effect by your tradition.</hi> God ſaied, (in it, thou ſhalt not worke) I ſay they, this is not to be regarded by Chriſtianes; for it is but Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Appurrenance yet further whither rend all theſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and euaſiones wherby men would deny Gods 7th day Sabbath? and whats the reaſon, that to this end, Gods Law muſt be thus rent and torne aſſunder? doe not the Authores of theſe things behaue themſelues, like men weary of Gods ſeruice, and as if it were a burden vnto them, to haue ſo many of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in his Church? and therfore they diminiſh the number,

Since that the authores of this diſtinction, doe grant, that ſome day in generall is by the 4th com. morall and perpetuall, I will proue, that that day muſt be Saturday the 7th day: my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe the other Sixe dayes are commanded in the 4th com. for the dayes of worke and labour: <hi>Sixe daies thou ſhalt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and doe all thou haſt to doe</hi> Exod. 20. now this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sixe dayes labour, is morall and perpetuall, neuer yet altered: and ſo ſaith <hi>M.

Exod. 20.11. For Saturday ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer came into the number of the Sixe dayes; neither by the commandement did the Iewes obſerue, or rekone any other daies for thoſe Sixe, but theſe I haue mentioned, as I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in my expoſition on theſe words of the 4th com. wherefore, if one day of the 7 be morall by the 4th com. and then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer 6 of thoſe 7 daies, be ordeined for worke by the 4th com. then it muſt follow, that that one day which is morall by the 4th com. is Saturday, the 7th day, and the laſt of the number: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of all the 7 dayes, none is left vacant for a Sabbath, but Saturday the 7th day; all the other daies being appointed by the 4th com. for worke.

                        <p n="5">5.

                        <p>On the contrary parte, they reaſon againſt the Antiquity of the Sabbath, out of Exod. 16.23. where it is thus written. <hi>To morrow is the rest of the Holy Sabbath vnto the Lord.</hi> Hence they gather, that the Iſraelites were ignorant of the Sabbath vntill this time, and conſequently that the Sabbath was not from the Creation: for if it had, Moſes ſhould not haue needed to tell them, that it was to morrow &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Herevnto I anſwer: the Lord teld his people from Mount Sinay, that the 7th day was the Sabbath Exod. 20.10. Againe after that, he teld them in Leuit. 23.3. that the 7th day was the Sabbath: now will it hence follow, that becauſe God teld the Iſraelites in Leuit. 23.3. that the 7th day was the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; therfore the Iſraelites were ignorant of the Sabbath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Againe, in their owne text Exod. 16.25. <hi>Moſes ſaid, eate that to day, for to day is a Sabbath vnto the Lord &amp;c.</hi> will it hence follow, that becauſe Moſes teld the Jſraelites, that that day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent was the Lords Sabbath, therefore they knew not ſo much before? the contrary is plaine but two verſes before: For in Exod. 16.23. Moſes had teld them ouer night, or the day before, that on the morrow ſhould be the Sabbath day.</p>
                        <p>The text therfore is not to be vnderſtod, as if Moſes had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them of the Sabbath day, whereof they were before ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nt;
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:21140:301"/>but that he informed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what they ſhould doe with their Manna on the Sabbath day, whereof they were ignorant before: for this ſee the context, in v. 19.

                        <p>Againe they reaſon againſt the Antiquity of the Sabbath from Exod. 31.13. where the Sabbath was made a ſigne betwixt God and the Iſraelites: whence they thus reaſon, that if the Sabbath had bene from the Creation, it had bene no more a ſigne vnto the Iſraelits then vnto the Gentiles &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, if the Sabbath had bene a ſigne from the Creation, as it was a Sabbath from the Creation, as this argument falſly ſuppoſeth, the argument had had more culler: it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the Sabbath was made a ſigne from its firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no more then the <hi>Rocke</hi> was a ſigne from its firſt Creation, 1.

The ſigne was but aduenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſe, &amp; added to the Sabbath after its inſtitution: wherefore, the Sabbath if it had bene a ſigne from the Creation, then it ſhould haue bene a ſigne as well vnto Gentiles as vnto Iewes: but it being made a ſigne among the Iewes onely, it might be a ſigne vnto Iewes and none vnto Gentiles: ſince therefore the Sabbath was not a ſigne originally, as it was when it made a

                        <p>I anſwer, foraſmuch as the Law written in the heart begane to be obliterated before the giuing of the Law, therefore the Gentiles might be ignorant of Gods Sabbaths, &amp; ſo God in mercy might ſpare them, <hi>The time of this ignorance God regarded not,</hi> ſaith Paul Act. 17.30. The Iewes hauing a cleerer light then the Gentiles, they were the more obnoxious, and theſe the leſſe. 2. whereas they ſay, that God no where reproued the Gentiles for Sabbath breaking: how know they this? ſince all things done among the Jewes, were not written, much leſſe the things done among the Gentiles. 3. by the like abſurd reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ing, we may proue, that other of the moralls were not from the Creation: becauſe God neuer reproued the Gentiles, for the breach of them neither.

                        <p>I anſwer 1. if theſe words be taken properly, then they will make as much againſt the antiquity of the wholl Morall Law, as againſt Gods Holy Sabbath: now it is manifeſt, that the Morall Law was more ancient, then the giuing of the Law on Mount Sinay: for we read of diuerſe parts thereof, in the booke of Geneſis. 2. whereas Moſes ſaid, the Lord made this Couenant with them aliue onely in <hi>Horeb</hi> v. 2. it is manifeſt, that it was not onely made in Horeb, but before: for we reade of one branch of this couenant made at leaſt a moneth before, in the

If the law of the Sabbath, the 4th com. did not bind vntill it was deliuered on Mount Sinay, then did none of the other Nyne com. bind neither, vntill they were deliuered on Mount Sinay: vnleſſe you will ſay that the Law had not euer tenn commandements in it, and that the law is not of a Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue nature. 2. It were moſt ſtrange to ſuppoſe, that God ſhould giue an example, more then 2000 yeeres before any ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it: for wherefore are examples, but for to be imitated? 3. When our Sauiour ſaid, The Sabbath was made for man, Mark. 2.27. he meaneth not, that it was made at the Creation for an example vſeleſſe, but for mans vſe, as to reſt in it &amp;c. 4. Can any man thinke it, that God ſhould ſanctify the 7th day, and ſo make it an holy day, at the Creation, and then ſuffer it to be profaned and polluted, for 2000 yeeres after, vntill the Iſralites came into the wilderneſſe? or, can any man thinke, that God ſhould make a Sabbath day at the Creation, for the people of the Iewes onely? who were not a people diſtinct of nere 2000 yeeres after, and not for the Patriarkes alſo, who liued before the flood? or, can we thinke that the Fathers before the flood, had Sacrifices, and no Sabbaths? that they had the worſhip of God, and no time allotted for it? or can we thinke, that the Church of God from the Creation, had no day ſet aparte, for
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:21140:303"/>a thankfull &amp; holy remembrance of the Creation of the world, vntill they were come into the wilderneſſe?</p>

                        <p>My ſecond reaſon to proue that the Sabbath was from the Creation is, becauſe the 4th com. muſt be ſuppoſed, to be as ancient, as are the other nyne commandements of the Decalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue (for the Decalogue is holden of all, to be as ancient as the world) and ſo it muſt be, for elſe the Law were not of a copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue nature; the 10 commandements were not linked together, as a chaine of many linkes: for one linke, to wit, the 4th in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the chaine ſhould be wanting, contrary vnto Iam. 2.10. &amp; contrary to the doctrine of all Diuines. 2. If the 4th co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. were not as ancient as the other 9 commandements, then it muſt be abſurdly ſuppoſed, that the Decalogue had not alwaies 10 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements in it, as it had Deut. 10.4. If then the 4th com. be as ancient as are the other 9 commandements, then the Sabbath therein commanded, muſt be as ancient, as is the Morall Law, which is for antiquity from the Creation.</p>
                        <p>It may be obiected, that there is no mention of the Sabbath day, vntill the Law was giuen vpon Mount Sinay, Exod. 20. or at ſooneſt in the wilderneſſe of Sin, Exo, 16.1.23. well, be it ſo, but doth it follow, that becauſe it was not ſooner mentioned, it was not therefore ſooner in vſe? the Law againſt murther, it is not mentioned at the ſooneſt, vntill after the murther of Abell Geneſ. 4.15. but will it thereof follow, that there was no Law againſt murther, before <hi>Kaine</hi> killed Habel? we know, many things there were, which were not recorded; for elſe the world could not conteine the bookes Ioh. 21.25. on the contrary, for ſo much as we find, that the Sabbath was in vſe Exo. 16.23. before the 4th com. was giuen on mount Sinay, Ex. 20.1.8. it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moſt likly, that it was from the Creation: for if it had not its firſt originall at Mount Sinay, when can it be thought to haue its begining, but at the Creation, together with the other commandements of the Decalogue?</p>

                        <p>My third reaſon, that the Sabbath was from the Creation is, becauſe we find not the <hi>Spirituall workes</hi> of the Sabbath day par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:21140:304"/>expreſſed in the 4th com. giuen vpon Mount Sinay Exod. 20. nor yet in the mention of the ſame Law before, in the wilderneſſe of Sin, Exo. 16. which is an argument, that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day was in vſe, and the manner how to ſanctify it, was well knowne vnto the Iewes, before either of theſe Lawes were written Exod. 20. or Exod. 16.5.23.28. otherwiſe, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would in ſome of theſe textes, haue expreſſed particularly vnto them, after what manner, and where withall they ſhould ſanctifie this day: The ſame is alſo confirmed, by the firſt word of the 4th com. Remember: <hi>Remember the Sabbath day, to ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it:</hi> ſignifying that they knew before, and could cale it to minde againe, how to <hi>Sanctify</hi> the Sabbath day; and therefore touching this point, the Lord needed not ſay any more vnto them, but Remember it &amp;c. I haue often maruailed in my ſelfe, why it ſhould pleaſe God, ſo punctually &amp; expreſly to mention, the corporall obſeruation of the Sabbath, in reſting from bodily laboures, and be ſo ſilent as it were, in the Spirituall dueties of the Sabbath, which are the more excellent: doubtleſſe, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is becauſe the Sanctification of the Sabbath did not then begine, when the Law was giuen Exod. 20. or Exo. 16. but that it was an ancient ordinance of Gods, long before in the Church, &amp; in the memory of all men before the giuing of the Law, as were the other Morales in the Decalogue; ſo as they knew how to ſanctify the day, and with what dueties.</p>
                        <p>I confeſſe it, that the Lord vſeth the word <hi>Sanctify</hi> in the 4th com. which doth in generall imply the particular meanes and waies of ſanctifying the day, but it doth not ſhew vs how or whereby in particular, the day ſhould be ſanctified: how know we at this day, where withall to ſanctify the Sabbath day? we rather find is by obſeruation, how the Church of God euer did ſanctifie it, then by the 4th com. as farre as euer I could vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; we find the people and Church of God, conſtantly ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it with <hi>ſacred actiones:</hi> for they had on that day, holy conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationes and aſſemblies, Leuit. 23.3. then the people reſorted vnto the Prophets for inſtruction ij. King. 4, 23. then the Sacred Scriptures were publiquly red, Act. 15.21. then they ſung Pſalmes, Pſal. 92. then the people did <hi>worſhip</hi> before the Lord at
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:21140:304"/>the gate of the Temple, Ezek. 46.1.3. on this day our Sauiour Chriſt, and his Apoſtles after him, did conſtantly preach vnto the people, Luk. 4.16. &amp;c. Act. 13.44. Act. 16.13. Act. 17.2. Act. 18.4. Now as we learne, what God meant by the word <hi>Sanctifie</hi> in the 4th com. by the obſeruation how Gods Church did ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Sabbath day in their practiſe, ſo no doubt, thoſe Iſralites in the wilderneſſe, knew what God meant by the word <hi>ſanctify,</hi> by the conſtant practiſe of their anceſtores before them.</p>

                        <p>My 4th reaſon is drawne from the firſt word of the 4th com. Remember: <hi>Remember the Sabbath day, to ſanctify it</hi> &amp;c. now in aſmuch as God commanded thoſe Iewes at Mount Sinay, to <hi>remember</hi> the Sabbath day, it implieth that the Sabbath day was in vſe before then, and that they knew it, and could cale it to minde againe: for remembrance implieth the caling to mind of a thing forepaſt and foreknowne.</p>
                        <p>Hereto ſome may thus anſwer, admit this word remember hath relation to the Sabbath as foreknowne, yet there may be a double relation, the one to the Sabbath as inſtituted from the Creation, the other to it as commanded in the wilderneſſe of Sin Exod. 16. But that this word remember, hath relation to a knowledge beyond that in the wilderneſſe of Sin, &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently vnto the Creation, it will appeare 1. By this, that God bad them remember to <hi>Sanctify</hi> the Sabbath day, now how to ſanctify the Sabbath day in a ſpeciall manner, as hath bene ſhowne, they lerned not by the 4th commandement Exod. 20. Nor in the wilderneſſe of Sin Exod. 16. and therefore this word remember had reference to times before their being in the wilderneſſe of Sin. 2. It is nothing probable, that this word ſhould haue reference but vnto the Iſraelites being in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of Sin: for, the mention of the Sabbath in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Sin, was but one moneth before the giuing of the Law, on Mount Sinay, as you may ſee Exod. 16.1. Exod. 19.1. Now can it be thought, the Jſraelites were of ſo brittle memories, to forget a law giuen them but one moneth before, as they ſhould ſtand in need to haue the word Remember added ſo ſhortly after? is it not by farre the more likly, that this word had refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:21140:305"/>vnto ſome long time before, as vnto the Creation, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory whereof ſtod in neede of a ſpeciall Memorandum, leaſt they ſhould forget it? yea, doth not the reaſon annexed to the commandement Exod. 20.11. drawne from Gods hallowing of the 7th day at the Creation, to moue the Iewes to ſanctifie the 7th day, imply ſo much? as if the Lord ſaid, becauſe I reſted on the 7th day at the Creation, &amp; therefore bleſſed it, &amp; ſanctified it for your holy vſe, therefore forget it not, though it was done long ſince, but Remember it, to ſanctifie it &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>My 5th reaſon: we doe not onely learne it from our Sauiour, that <hi>the Sabbath was made for man</hi> Mark. 2.27.

                     <p>WHen I had founde out by diligent ſtudy (Chriſtian Reader) that this moſt ancient ordinance of Gods Sabbath, is ſtill in force; in the next place I gaue my ſelfe ſeriouſly to thinke of the practiſe of it; whither to fale to preſent practiſe, or to waite ſome more fit ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>When I thought of a preſent practiſe, then theſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences preſented themſelues. 1. If we fale vpon the preſent practiſe, then the Magiſtrate will be offended; becauſe we make a ſchiſme and rente in the Church. 2. Our Chriſtian brethren will be offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded; becauſe we diuid &amp; ſeparate from their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: &amp; both of theſe will take it the worſe, when they thinke of our raſhneſſe &amp; inconſideracy, that we will forſake the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe &amp; fellowſhip of the Church, before we haue giuen them time ſufficient to conſider of the matter, as we our ſelues haue had, whereby we ſhould haue waited for their approbation in iudgement, &amp; reformation together with vs in practiſe: and herevpon may ariſe greate diuiſiones of heart, &amp; much hartbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:21140:306"/>betwixt brethren, who ſhould liue in amity &amp; godly loue. 3. As in the two former, we ſhould doe that which would be euill to our brethren; ſo alſo ſhould we doe that which would proue euill vnto our ſelues; &amp; that in a double reſpect. 1. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our bodies. 2. in reſpect of our ſoules: for the former, we liue not, as they doe in ſome parte of the world, who are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to practiſe what they will in matter of conſcience, but we liue vnder an eſtabliſhed gouernment, where we cannot tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the lawes thereof, without perill to our perſones &amp; goods. For the latter, if we enter vpon a preſent practiſe of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, then we rune into this ſpirituall inconuenience, that we ſhall pine our ſoules, for want of that ſpirituall food, which we were wont to inioy vpon the Lords day, &amp; which is needfull vpon the Sabbath day: for the lawes of our kingdome, will not permit priuat conue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticles, or that a miniſter ſhould preach in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate: &amp; therfore we cannot haue the benefite of an able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, to helpe vs in the ſinctification of the Sabbath, &amp; to feede our ſoules with the bread of life: theſe are the inconveniences which attend vpon the preſent practiſe.</p>
                     <p>But when I thought of a delay, and to waite ſome more fit ſeaſon for the practiſe, then this euill preſented it ſelfe, that, by the neglect of a preſent practiſe, we fale into ſinne, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the 4th commandement by prophanation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; &amp; we ſhould be guilty thereof, vntill that ſit ſeaſon of reformation cometh: ſo whither ſoeuer I turned me, I ſaw my ſelfe in a ſtraite: for, the former inconveniences, would be auoided; but this latter, of neceſſity muſt be ſhuned.</p>
                     <p>VVhilſt I was at a ſtand, it pleaſed God to cauſe me thinke of a diſpenſation; the which after J had ſeriouſly conſidered of, I reſolued, that the word of God would beare a diſpenſation in this caſe; &amp; ſo it ſhould come to paſſe, that we ſhould ſhune the inconveniencies on the one ſide, &amp; the ſinne on the other; &amp; ſo we might walke on comfortablie, without offence either to God, or to man, or iniury to our ſelues.</p>
                     <p>Let vs now therefore addreſſe our ſelues vnto this Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: touching which, firſt we will handle this queſtion in generall; whither a man is bound in conſcience, to conforme his

                     <p>For this purpoſe note, that God hath giuen vs a morall Law touching wedlocke, to wit, the 7th commandement: <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery:</hi> now our Sauiour ſaith, that whoſoeuer mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a diuorced woman, committeth adultery; &amp; the woman committeth adultery alſo, in caſe ſhee was diuorced for any thing beſids hir adultery Mat. 5.32.

                     <p>The conſideration of this, may be of vſe, to ſtopp the mouths of ſuch as cry out, ſaying, what, a diſpenſation from a Morall Law? if the Sabbath be a morall, then there can be no diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: but loe, here they ſee the contrary; the 7th commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a Morall, &amp; yet there was a diſpenſation touching it: for Moſes permitted that for the hardneſſe of the lewes hearts, which from the begining was not ſo, &amp; which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour accounted to be adultery, &amp; ſo againſt the 7th comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement:

Here Dauid knew well, that it was his office, to haue put Ioab to death, &amp; he was willing ſo to haue done, neuertheleſſe, becauſe he was but weake in his kingdome, &amp; Ioab ſtrong, it might haue made a commotion in his kingdome, &amp; much hurly burly, &amp; blood ſhed, &amp; hazard of his Crowne: now in this exegency &amp; extremity, Dauid did neglect to doe for a ſeaſon, what he knew he ſhould haue done, &amp; would haue done moſt gladly, but that the times would not beare it. Thus you haue ſeene a diſpenſation in two examples.</p>
                     <p>A third inſtance ſhall be that of the omiſſion of circumciſion: you know it was a Law, that euery man child of 8 dayes old, ſhould be circumciſed Geneſ. 17.12. Now though the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites knew this, yet they circumciſed not their children, for 40. yeeres together, euen all the time they were in the wilderneſſe, as you may reade Ioſh. 5.5. So here againe was a diſpenſation for a ſeaſon, in a caſe of neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>A fourth inſtance ſhall be that of Dauids eating the Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread: Dauid knew that the Shewbread was to be eaten by the prieſt onely; neuertheleſſe, Dauid in a caſe of preſent hunger, did eate the Shewbread, contrary to the Law, &amp; Chriſt doth iuſtify him in it Mat. 12.3.4. ſo here againe is a diſpenſation in a caſe of neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>A fifth example, ſhall be that of the Diſciples plucking and rubbing eares of corne, on the Sabbath day, which was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be done on the Sabbath day; Neuertheleſſe, in a caſe of preſent neceſſity, they did plucke and alſo rubb the eares of corne, which was elſe vnlawfull to be done, and Chriſt iuſtiſied
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:21140:308"/>it: ſo here againe, you ſee a diſpenſation in ſome caſe. By all which inſtances it is more then manifeſt, that exceptiones and diſpenſationes from ſomething commanded, may be, in ſome caſes.</p>
                     <p>Theſe inſtances doe put an anſwer into our mouths, againſt them who cry out ſaying, ſince you know it, &amp; are perſwaded, that Saturday is the Sabbath, why keepe you it not &amp;c? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Dauid knew it to be his office, to ſlay the murtherer: and Dauid knew, that he ſhould not eate Shewbread: now tell me why Dauid, &amp; the reſt, did not doe what they knew. And ſo much for the former queſtion, and now I come vnto the latter.</p>

                     <p>In this Section I ſhall come more particularly to the point in hand: &amp; here I ſhall ſhew you, that in a caſe of neceſſity, ſuch as know that the Sabbath day is ſtill in force, may neglect it for a ſeaſon, vntill the time of reformation, ſo be they giue God for it, an other day in the meane while, by way of a change. And this J ſhall proue vnto you by two arguments. The former is this, that the Sabbath day may be changed in a caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: becauſe it may be neglected or profaned in a caſe of neceſsity. And thus I frame it.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore the Sabbath day may be changed, in a caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By changing the Sabbath; day; I meane nothing elſe but this, that we giue God the Sunday in ſteade of the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day for a ſeaſon; the 8 day for the 7th; or to keepe the Lords day with our Church for a ſeaſon, in the roome of the Sabbath day: like as if a King ſhould prorogue his Coronation day, and by reaſon of the plague or other neceſſity, ſhould keepe its ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, on an other day then the accuſtomed day.</p>
                        <p>So I come to the profe of the Major or firſt propoſition; but I may ſpare labour, it is cleere enough of it ſelfe, none I thinke will deny it: for it is a leſſe euill, or loſſe to God (if I may ſo
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:21140:308"/>ſpeake) to chang a day with him, then to take a day from him; or neglect a day; like as it is a leſſe loſſe to a man, to chang a ſhilling with him, in a caſe of neceſſity, though it be a light &amp; clypt ſhilling, for an heauy &amp; waity one, then it is to take a ſhilling from him, or then it is to neglect to paye him a ſhilling, which I owe him. But happily ſome may obiect, that there may be no changings in Gods ordinances. Wherevnto I anſwer, that the contrary is true; for whereas the Paſſeouer was to be in the firſt moneth of the yeere, Leuir. 23.5. The godly king <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> changed the day of the Paſſeouer, from the firſt moneth of the yeere, vnto the ſecond moneth of the yeere, in a caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as you may reade ij Chron. 30.2.3. Wherefore, there may be ſome changes in Gods worſhip in ſome caſe, as in a caſe of neceſſity. And ſo much for the Major.</p>
                        <p>I come next to the profe of the Minor, or ſecond propoſition; and here I am to proue, that the Sabbath day, may be neglected or profaned, in a caſe of neceſſity: and this I proue. 1. Becauſe other dueties may be neglected &amp; omitted in a caſe of neceſſity the neglect wherof were ſinnes, as well as the neglect of he Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, if omitted out of the caſe of neceſſity: for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, Moſes might neglect to puniſh ſome kind of adultery: Diuid might omit to execute Ioab for his murther: The Iſraelites might neglect circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Dauid might eate the ſhewbread in a time of hunger: all which we haue inlarged in the Section before this. Now the omiſſion or neglect of all theſe were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, out of the caſe of neceſſity, as well as the neglect of the Sabbath day; and therefore there is the like reaſon of all.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I proue it by this, that our Sauiour Chriſt, did allow his Diſciples and others, to neglect and profare the Sabbath day in his time, in a caſe of neceſſity: As for his Diſciples, when they profaned the Sabbath day, by plucking eares of corne, and by rubbing of them, it being done in a caſe of preſent hunger, our Sauiour iuſtiſied them in it Mat. 12.1.2.3. &amp;c. As for others, our Sauiour iuſtified them, when they profaned the Sabbath day, by moyling &amp; toyling, to lift a beaſt out of a pit, on the Sabbath day, it being a caſe of neceſſity Mat. 12.11.</p>
                        <p n="3">3dly I proue it by the Teſtimony of all Diuines, who are of
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:21140:309"/>iudgment, that a man may profane the whole Sabbath day, by hard &amp; painfull laboures, if it be in a caſe of neceſſity, as to quench an howſe on fyer, on the Sabbath day: or to fly before the enemy, he purſuing vs, to ſaue our life: or to reſiſt the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a forraigne enemy on the Sabbath day.</p>
                        <p n="4">4thly I proue it by this, that <hi>The Sabbath was made fur man, &amp; not man for the Sabbath,</hi> as our Sauiour ſaith Mark. 2.27. Now if that when man is in an exegency &amp; extremity, he muſt rather obſerue the Sabbath, then prouide for his owne ſafety, then the Sabbath ſhould not be made for man; but contrarily, man ſhould be made for the Sabbath: &amp; this Chriſt doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly deny, ſaying, that <hi>man was not made for the Sabbath:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of the two, if the caſe be at ſuch an hard point, that the one muſt be neglected, &amp; cannot be auoided, then ſuch is the mercy of God to man, as his ordinance of the Sabbath ſhall giue way (I truſt none will beſo profane, &amp; vngratiouſly vngratefull, as to abuſe this mercy of God, making neceſſity, when he needeth not) Now that I doe not abuſe theſe words of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, ſhall appeare, if you looke but into the context Mark. 2.23.27. Where our Sauiour, defendeth his Diſciples, plucking &amp; rubing the eares of corne on the Sabbath, to ſatisfie their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by ſhewing one vſe &amp; end of the Sabbath day, namely, that it was made for mans benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="5">5thly, I proue that the Sabbath may be neglected and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned in a caſe of neceſſity, and that by all men who are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, and vnder the juriſdiction of Magiſtrates: now my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe <hi>ſeruantes</hi> may prophane the Sabbath in a caſe of neceſſity: Thus I argue, <hi>If ſeruants may prophane the Sabbath, then ſubiectes may doe ſo too:</hi> For there is one and the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, betwene the ſubiect and the Magiſtrate, that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the ſubiect and the Magiſtrate, that there is betwene the ſeruant and maſter. <hi>But ſeruantes in a caſe of neceſsity, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:21140:309"/>the Sabbath.</hi> As namely in this caſe of neceſſity, when their maſters command them to worke on the Sabbath; then there is a neceſſity vpon them: for God commandeth ſeruants to obey their Maſters Col. 3.22. <hi>Therefore ſubiects may in a caſe of neceſsity prophane the Sabbath alſo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If any ſhall aske if there be like neceſsity for ſubiects to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Sabbath, as there is for ſeruants, when commanded by their Maſters, I anſwer there is, for. 1. our Magiſtrates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand vs to follow the workes of our calings on Saturday, which is the Sabbath day. And 2. Gods word commandeth ſubiects to yeeld obedience to Magiſtrates Rom. 13.1.</p>
                        <p>But againſt the Minor, the 4th commandement will be obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which forbiddeth ſeruants to worke on the Sabbath day, and we muſt obey God rather then man. I anſwer by a deniall; the 4th commandement doth no where forbid a ſeruant to worke on the Sabbath, when he is commanded by his Maſter to worke, but onely when he may forbeare worke by his Maſters allowance. For the cleering of this, note, that as the 5th com. is directed vnto inferioures, ſo the 4th commandement is direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto Superioures; the commandement ſaith not, <hi>Thou</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant ſhalt doe no worke; as ſpoken to the ſeruant: but, <hi>Thy</hi> ſeruant ſhall doe no worke, as ſpoken of the ſeruant, but to the Maſter; binding the Maſter abſolutly and expreſly, and the ſeruant conſequently and in this reſpect, if he may haue his Maſters allowance: the 5th commandement ſpeakes of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioures, but laies the charge expreſly on Inferioures; ſo the 4th commandement ſpeakes of Seruants, but laies the charge on Maſters expreſly: Honor thy father, this is ſpoken to the Sonne; ſo, Thy ſeruant ſhall doe no worke, in propriety of ſpeech, is ſpoken to the Maſter: it is the Seruant that is ſpoken of, it is the Maſter that is ſpoken to. Further I anſwer, that as no clauſe in the commandement, ſo no conuincing argument can be fetched out of the commandement, to proue that a ſeruant is abſolutly bound to reſt on the Sabbath, his Maſter commanding him the contrary.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I anſwer, in Deut. 5.14.5. There is a reaſon added to the 4th commandement, perſwading to the obſeruation of it: and it
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:21140:310"/>perſwads Maſters to giue reſt vnto their ſeruants on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day. <hi>That thy man ſeruant, &amp; thy maid may reſt as well as thou &amp;c.</hi> VVhich ſheweth, that the 4th commandement fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going was directed vnto Maſters not vnto ſeruants; and there fore bound the Maſters abſolutly and expreſly, but not the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes: for this reaſon cannot be applied vnto ſeruants. 3. conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the ſeruant is not at liberty, nor hath the power of himſelfe, but is at his maſters command, common reaſon incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs to expound the commandement rather as giuen to, and binding the Maſter, then the Seruant: this point you may ſee learnedly obſerued and handled, by <hi>M. Brerewood</hi> on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, againſt <hi>M. Byſield.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And ſo you ſee, that the Sabbath day may be profaned, in a caſe of true neceſſity. And ſo much for my former argument, whereby it appeareth, that in caſe of neceſsity, the Sabbath day may be changed, and ſo the Lords day keptin roome of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, till the time of reformation.</p>
                        <p>My ſecond argument to proue that the Sabbath day may be changed for a ſeaſon is; becauſe the Paſſeouer day might be changed for a ſeaſon; and thus I frame it.</p>

                        <p>I proue the firſt propoſition, or the conſequence to be good, becauſe there is like reaſon of both, that is, of the Paſſeouer day and of the Sabbath day: and this I make appeare in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. 1. As the Sabbath day was commanded by God Exod. 20.8. So alſo, the Paſſeouer day was commanded by God Exod. 12.2.6. 2dly, As on the Sabbath day, there muſt be holy Aſſemblies; and no ſeruile worke dore, Leuit. 23.3. So alſo, on the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer day or Paſſeouer Sabbath day, there was to be holy Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:21140:310"/>and no ſeruile worke done Leuit. 23.8. 3dly, as the breach of the Sabbath day, was to be puniſhed with death Exod. 31.15. So alſo, the breach of the Paſſeouer day, was to be Puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with death Numb. 9.13. Thus you ſee how like the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer day, was to the Sabbath day: for 1. they haue both the ſame Author, God. 2. They were to be ſanctified with holy aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and reſt from laboures both alike. 3. They were to be ſtrictly kept, the one as well as the other; for there was one and the ſame puniſhment, to be inflicted vpon the tranſgreſſoures of both, alike. Now they being thus alike both, what hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that there ſhould not be like reaſon of them both? it was a ſinne to trangreſſe the one, and it was a ſinne to tranſgreſſe the other alſo: now if it were no ſinne then, to neglect the one, &amp; make a chang in a caſe of neceſsity; why ſhould it be a ſinne, to neglect the other, &amp; make a chang in a caſe of neceſsity? why ſhould there not be like reaſon, of things that were ſo like?</p>
                        <p>But herevnto happly ſome will obiect, that the Paſſeouer day was a Ceremony, but the Sabbath day you hould to be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; and therefore thers not like reaſon. Wherevnto I anſwer, that this is a friuolouſe obiection, for 1. God hath aſwell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a diſpenſation in morales, as in ceremoniales: for God by Moſes permitted a diſpenſation againſt the 7th commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſome kind, and that too vpon worſe conditiones then is our preſent caſe of neceſsity, as ſhall appeare: for Diuorce was permitted for the hardneſſe of the Iewes heartes: but our diſpenſation ſhall appeare to be a better caſe &amp; condition then that, to be a more warrantable neceſsity, as you ſhall ſee when we come to it by &amp; by. 2. I anſwer, be it that becauſe the one was a Ceremony, and the other a Morall, that therefore God had leſſe regard vnto the Ceremony, then he hath vnto the Morall; yet this maketh but a difference betwixt them of leſſe &amp; more; the one being leſſe regarded, the other more regarded: Now this difference hindreth not the argument, <hi>Magis &amp; minus non variat ſpeciem,</hi> as Logiceans ſpeake, a peece of ſiluer of nyne pence, is like a peece of ſiluer of twelue pence, they being both ſiluer, though the one be a leſſer peece, &amp; the other a greater peece: now if it be permitted vnto A Debitor, to exchang with
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:21140:311"/>his Creditour, &amp; giue him ſixe pence in ſtead of his nyne pence, in a caſe of neceſsity; then by like reaſon &amp; proportion, euery man will iudge, that it is permitted vnto him, in like caſe, to giue him a nyne peny peece, for a peece of twelue pence: but eſpecially, if the neceſsity for the greater chang, doth exceed the neceſsity for the leſſer chang, &amp; this is our caſe: for the chang of the Ceremoniall Paſſeouer day which is the leſſer, might be vpon this one neceſsity, if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were in a farre iourney: but our chang of the Sabbath day which is the greater, is vpon a neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſting of 4 branches, as you ſhall ſee by &amp; by, which as they exceed the other in number, ſo alſo in weight, if they be compared together. By which demonſtration, you ſee this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection though common, yet friuolouſe. And thus much for profe of the conſequence or firſt propoſition.</p>
                        <p>I come now to proue the Minor or ſecond propoſition: to wit, That the paſſeouer day might be neglected, and an other day kept in its roome for a ſeaſon, in a caſe of neceſſity: for profe of this ſee Numb. 9.5. where the Iſralites kept the paſſeouer in the 14th day of the firſt moneth; according to the time appointed of God, at its firſt inſtitution, as you may ſee v. 1,2. and Leuit. 23.5. and Exod. 12.2.6. now it ſo fell out, that ſome men in the Congregation, were defiled by touching of a dead corpſe; and ſo they were debarred from keeping the paſſeouer at that time with the Congregation. Herevpon they came before Moſes &amp; Aaron for counſaile; &amp; Moſes not knowing what to doe in this caſe, he repaireth to God for direction; wherevpon the Lord maketh him this anſwer, <hi>If any among you ſhall be vncleane by reaſon of a dead body, or be in a long iourney, he ſhall keepe the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouer in the</hi> 14th <hi>day of ſecond moneth &amp;c.</hi> Numb.9.6.7.8.9.10.11. So hereby you ſee, that howbeit the paſſeouer was by its prime inſtitution, to be kept in the 14th day of the firſt moneth; yet in a caſe of neceſſity, the time was changed, from the firſt moneth, vnto the ſecond moneth; and ſo the daies and times commanded in the Law, at the prime inſtitution, were neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and profaned by thoſe which had this neceſſity vpon them: the caſes in which the paſſeouer time was changed, were. 1. If a man had touched a dead corps. 2. If a man were from home,
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:21140:311"/>in a farre iourney, and thus much for profe of the Minor.</p>
                        <p>Neuertheleſſe to this argument, ſome doe anſwer thus, that it is true indeed, that there was a diſpenſation for the paſſeouer day, but it was giuen by God himſelfe, but ſo is not your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the Sabbath day; for there is no exception that can be ſhowne for the chang of the Sabbath day in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as their is for the paſſeouer day. Herevnto I reply, that this anſwer is very abſurd, for it denieth all argumentation, &amp; col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiones from the Scriptures, for they will not grant the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, vnleſſe it be proued by an expreſſe text of Scripture, in ſo many words; for they will haue an expreſſe diſpenſation in ſo many words, ſhowne for a chang of the Sabbath day in the Scriptures, as well as there is a diſpenſation to be ſhowne for the paſſeouers chang in the Scriptures. Furthermore, if they will not gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Sabbath day may be changed now, becauſe the paſſeouer day might be changed in old time, how will they doe to proue, that we may baptize infants now, becauſe they did circumciſe infints in old time? for thers no expreſſe word of God for either; they muſt both be inferred by collection from other Scriptures, yet further, wherefore is it, that S. Paul ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to the things written in the old Teſtament, if we may not collect and learne from them, to doe the like in like caſes? <hi>Whatſoeuer things are written a fore time are written for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> Rom. 15.4. After the Law for the paſſeouer was giuen, there fell out extraordinary occurrences, in which Moſes could not tell what to doe, wherefore he had recourſe vnto God for direction, Numb. 9.10.11. So, after the Law for the Sabbath was giuen, there is falne out an extraordenary occurrence, the Sabbath hath bene profaned now for 1000 or 1200 yeeres, now how to worke a reformation hereof we are at our wites ends, &amp; we cannot now a daies haue ſuch recourſe vnto God, as Moſes had for direction; wherefore now we muſt to the Lawe &amp; to the Teſtimonies, and borrow light from former preſidents.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I ſhall proue it vnto you, that we may extend this diſpenſation of the paſſeouer day, further then it is expreſſed by Gods diſpenſation in Numb. 9.10.11. ſo be we doe it by like reaſon: for this end note, that the Lord gaue leaue to chang the
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:21140:312"/>the paſſeouer in theſe two caſes, 1. If a man had touched a dead corps. 2. If a man were in a farre iourney: but the good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> keeping the paſſeouer long after, he fell into other extremities and <hi>straites;</hi> and he could not keepe the paſſeouer on the 14th day of the <hi>first</hi> moneth, but profaned it, and made a chang, vnto the 14 day of the <hi>ſecond</hi> moneth, and that vpon theſe two occations. 1. Becauſe hee had not Prieſts enough ſanctified, or becauſe the Prieſts were not ſufficiently ſanctified. 2. Becauſe the people were not come vp together to Jeruſalem, or had not aſſembled themſelues at Ieruſalem, as you may reade ij. Chron. 30.2.3. Now theſe two extremities, &amp; reaſons of Hezekiah his chang, were not the very ſame, which God ſpecified in Numb. 9.10.11. but yet they were ſuch as might be collected by like reaſon: whereby it appeareth, that we may goe beyond the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the text, ſo be we hold cloſſe to the like reaſon: &amp; this I haue done, in fetching my argument from the paſſeouer day to the Sabbath day; for I haue held me to like reaſon of them both, as you haue ſeene.</p>
                        <p>And ſo much for proofe, that the Lords day may be kept for the Sabbath day by way of A change, for a ſeaſon, in a caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. But yet it remaineth, that I proue now, that our caſe in changing the Sabbath day for the Lords day, is a caſe of neceſſity; &amp; this being done, all is firme; for this therefore, ſee the next ſection.</p>

                     <p>In this ſection I ſhall proue vnto you, that there is a true neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity vpon vs, to neglect the Sabbath day for a ſeaſon, and to keepe the Lords day with our Church for it, and in roome of it.</p>
                     <p>This neceſſity I ſhall declare vnto you. 1. In reſpect of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. 2. In reſpect of our ſoules. 3. In reſpect of our brethren. &amp; firſt of the firſt of theſe touching our bodies: and in this reſpect, I ſhall make neceſſity appeare two waies; the former is this; that if we keepe the 7th day or Saturday Sabbath, then we ſhall haue but 5 daies in a weeke to prouide for our bodies, and to compaſſe the workes of our caleings in: for, when we haue kept the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath, the Magiſtrate will compell vs, by the lawes of the Realme, to keepe the Sunday alſo: &amp; ſo we ſhall haue but 5 daies
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:21140:312"/>in euery weeke, or in euery 7 daies, to performe the workes of our caleings in: now it is of neceſſity, that we ſhould haue 6 daies in euery weeke ordenarily, or in euery 7 daies, to doe the workes of our caleings in: becauſe, elſe God would not haue allowed man 6 daies to worke in for himſelfe, &amp; haue taken but one for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as he did in the 4th com. Exod. 20.8. now ſince there is a neceſſity, that we haue 6 daies ordinarily in euery weeke, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our caleings in, it is of neceſſity, that we neglect the Sabbath day, &amp; worke in it, for a ſeaſon; vnles the Magiſtrate will diſpenſe with his Lawe, touching the Lords day; or vntill it ſhall pleaſe God, to incline the heart of the Magiſtrate, to proclaime a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that ſo the Sabbath day may be kept: for vnleſſe the Magiſtrate doth one of theſe two, we can haue but 5 daies in euery weeke for our caleings, and ſo much for the former neceſſity in regard of our bodies.</p>
                     <p>I come now vnto the other neceſſity, in reſpect of our bodies, which is this, if we keepe the 7th day Sabbath, then we offend the Magiſtrate, and tranſgreſſe the Lawes of the Realme; &amp; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon will follow impriſonment of body, &amp; conſequently pouerty: for when a man is impriſoned, he muſt neglect his caleing, &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; &amp; ſo he ſhall be brought to a morſell of bread, &amp; hee, his wife, &amp; children which depend vpon him, ſhall come to want of things neceſſary: now who ſo ſhall incurre theſe euils, by keeping of the Sabbath day, to him there is a neceſſity to neglect the Sabbath day, namely the neceſſity of wante, pouerty, &amp; hunger.</p>
                     <p>Now leaſt any man ſhould maruaile, that I will plead this kind of neceſſity of all others, therefore I will ſtrengthen it, and that by the allowance of our Sauiour Chriſt, and practiſe of his Diſciples: for you reade, Mat. 12.1.2. How Chriſts Diſciples did neglect the Sabbath day, &amp; fell to plucking eares of corne, &amp; to rubbing them in their hands, Luk. 6.1. which workes they did on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, to preuent a little hunger; and Chriſt iuſtified this action. Now if hunger, was a caſe of neceſſity in Chriſts Diſciples, why ſhould not hunger be a caſe of neceſſity in vs alſo? and if they might worke on the Sabbath day, to preuent hunger; why may not we doe ſo too, to preuent hunger, and impriſonment alſo? yea
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:21140:313"/>to preuent penury, not in himſelfe alone, but in his whole family, wife and children? ſo our neceſſity is greater then was that of Chriſts Diſciples.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of this may be vſefull, to ſatisfy the obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones that riſe in the minds of ſome, ſaying, it ſeemeth then you haue more minde of your belly then of God; of your ſafety then of Gods Sabbaths: but the vanity of this obiection ſhall appeare by this, that the very ſame obiection beareth as ſtrongly, againſt Chriſts Diſciples, as againſt vs: for may not ſuch obiections riſe in your minds alſo, againſt Chriſts Diſciples? ſaying, it ſeemeth you minde your bellies more then your God, and you feare a little hunger more then the breach of Gods Sabbaths. thus you ſee the weakneſſe of this obiection, &amp; ſo much for the neceſſity in regard of our bodies.</p>
                     <p>I come now vnto the neceſsity in regard of our ſoules; &amp; here I ſhall make it appeare, that to keepe the Sabbath day, as things ſtand yet, it will pine our ſoules. And this I ſhall ſhew in two reſpectes; the former is this; you know the Sabbath day, ought to be ſolemniſed with Aſſemblies Leuit. 23.3. Now the benefit of company &amp; fellowſhip, in ſanctification of Gods Sabbaths, is of greate vſe, to kindle zeale and forwardneſſe in our fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>zen heartes, like as coales laid together burne more firuently, <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced (ſaith the Prophet Dauid) when they ſaid to me, wee will goe into the houſe of the Lord</hi> Pſ. 122.1. Now ſuch as are convinced of this trueth, to beleeue that the lords Sabbaths are ſtill in force, are fewe in number, as one in an houſe, two in a Towne, 3 or 4 in a Citty, like the cluſters that grow neereſt the ſunne, here one and there one ripe before the reſt; now if theſe thus diſperſed ſhould keepe the Lords Sabbath continually, ſolitarily &amp; alone, it is much to be feared, that their zeale wold waxe could, like burning coales, when ſcattered vpon the hearth, &amp; put aſunder; and ſo their ſoules ſhould languiſh and pine away as it were.</p>
                     <p>The other reſpect, whereby it will appeare, that there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity to chang the Sabbath day, leſt the ſoule pine, is this; you know that to the ſanctification of the Sabbath day, is required the helpe of the Miniſter Luk. 4.16. Act. 15.21. To goe before the people in the duety of prayer to God; &amp; to open the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:21140:313"/>feeding them with the bread of life, diuiding the word of God a right: now becauſe the lawes of our kingdome, will not permit priuate Conuenticles; &amp; becauſe there cannot be a Miniſter in euery family; therefore if we keepe the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths as things ſtand now, then wee muſt keepe them without that ordinance of Gods Miniſtry; &amp; ſo our ſoules ſhould lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh &amp; pine away, for lacke of the daily breade, the heauenly food of our ſoules; for we ſhould be depriued of our Sabbath dayes bread, and want the Sabbath daies meales: and this is an other caſe of neceſsity, whereinto we fale if we keepe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; and for the auoiding whereof, we may make a chang of the Sabbath day, into the Lords day for a ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is, that obedience to the 4th commandement requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth an aſſent and fellowſhip of others, which is not required in the other commandements: for a man may yeeld obedience to euery other commandement ſinglie and alone by himſelfe, though no man elſe will ioyne with him; but for this 4th com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement it cannot be obſerued, as it ſhould be without the fellowſhip and ſociety of others ioyning with him.</p>
                     <p>Now a word or two, for the iuſtifying of theſe two neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties touching the ſoule, to be true neceſsities, and ſuch as may warrant a chang of a day appointed by God: for the former, namely <hi>Aſsemblies:</hi> the want of aſſemblies, was one cauſe of the change of the Paſſeouer day, by Hezekiah, as you may reade ij Chro. 30.3. For the latter, namely, <hi>Miniſters:</hi> the want of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters or Prieſts, was an other cauſe of the paſſeouer dais chang, by Hezekiah, as you may reade in the forealleaged place, <hi>And the King and his Princes, And all the congregation had taken counſaile in Ieruſalem, to keepe the Paſseouer in the ſecond moneth: for they could not keepe it at this time, becauſe there were not Prieſts enough ſanctified, neither was the people gathered to Jeruſalem.</hi> 2 Chro. 30.2.3. Where you ſee, the want of the peoples aſſembly; and the want of Prieſts; were the ij cauſes, of the chang of this day from the firſt moneth, to the ſecond moneth.</p>
                     <p>I confeſſe our new Tranſlatores reade it thus, <hi>becauſe the Prists had not ſanctified themſelues ſufficiently:</hi> But this cometh ſtill to the ſame: for our Miniſters haue not yet ſanctified their
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:21140:314"/>vnderſtandings, from a profane opinion of the Lords Sabbaths; and therefore we cannot haue their helpe, to the ſanctification of the Sabbath day: ſo it is all one, whither there be not Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters enough; or whither thoſe that be, are not willing to yeeld vs their helpe; for both waies we ſhall want the helpe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, if we keepe the Sabbath day: and, if the Prieſts vnſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, were cauſe enough to chang the day; much more then, when Prieſts and Miniſters are both vnſufficient, and alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, ſo as they cannot be perſwaded to lend vs their helpe: and thus you ſee, that the want of people, and the want of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, are a ſufficient cauſe to make a chang of a day, and that the old day ſhould be profaned, whilſt an other is kept in its roome and ſteade.</p>
                     <p>If any ſhall aske me now, why I keepe not the Sabbath day, ſince it is my iudgement that it ought to be kept: my anſwer ſhall be. 1. That a man is not bound in all caſes, and at all times, to put in practiſe what he knoweth ſhould be done; as I haue ſhowne by the examples of Moſes, touching diuorcement: of Iſraelites omitting Circumciſion: of Dauids ſpareing Ioab: and eating Shewbread: and the reſt. And further, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, I keepe it not; becauſe as I haue proued, by two good arguments, that an other day may be kept for it, for a ſeaſon. 2. My anſwer ſhall be, that I keepe not the Sabbath day, becauſe I cannot keepe it, neceſſity lying vpon me. Now I cannot keepe it. 1. Becauſe ſo I ſhould haue but 5 daies in a weeke, to follow my caleing. 2. Becauſe ſo I ſhould impoueriſh my ſelfe and my family, which is a iuſtifiable plea, in this caſe of the Sabbath. 3. Becauſe I cannot haue aſſemblies on the Sabbath, to ioyne with in holy Sabbath exerciſes; and ſpecially becauſe, Miniſters will not preach to vs vpon the Saturday or Sabbath: for how ſhould we keepe the Saturday Sabbath, when Miniſters will not come to Church, and preach vnto vs on the Saturday? and my 4th reaſon and neceſſity is, that as I am a Subiect, ſo J ſtand bound to obey my gouerners, ſo long as they command me nothing, which Gods word hath forbidden mee: now they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me, to follow my caling, on the Saturday Sabbath; &amp; the 4th com. doth not forbid me the ſame, I being conſidered as a Subiect &amp; ſeruant vnto my ſuperioures.</p>
                     <pb n="593" facs="tcp:21140:314"/>
                     <p> But herevnto ſome will be redy to ſay, why if you can not keepe the Sabbath day as you would, why keepe it then as you may, without aſſemblies, and without a Miniſter, for God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth no more of a man then he can doe &amp;c. Herevnto I ſhall giue none other anſwer, then this, that the ſame obiection, layeth as well againſt the practiſe of the godly King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as againſt mee, &amp; hereby the abſurdety thereof ſhall appeare; why might not you as well obiect to Hezekiah when he put off the paſſeouer day, from the 14th day of the firſt moneth, to the 14th day of the ſecond moneth, vpon my reaſons, ſaying, why did not Hezekiah, keepethe paſſeouer, vpon the 14th day of the firſt moneth, which is the right day, &amp; the day eſtabliſhed at the inſtitution of the paſſeouer, ſince it was his iudgement that it ought to be then kept? what and if he could no haue the asſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the people, as he would; why yet he might haue kept the paſſeouer with that company he had in Ieruſalem, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his Princes, and Courtieres, and Cittizens of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; what needed he to profane the firſt paſſeouer day, and to chang it vnto an other day, for want of the reſidue of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? and what &amp; if he had not prieſts enough already ſanctified? or not ſufficiently ſanctified, why yet he might haue kept the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouer as he could with thoſe prieſts he had; or with the prieſts ſuch as they were whither ſufficienly or vnſufficiently ſanctified? for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hezekiah had tarried till the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d day, yet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many in the Congregation were not ſanctified as they ſhould be, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he praied ſaying, <hi>The good Lord be mercifull toward him that prepareth his whole heart to ſeeke the Lord God, though he be not cleanſed, according to the purification of the Sanctuary,</hi> ij Chro. 30.18.19. And why could not Hezekiah haue kept the paſſeouer on the firſt day, with people, and Prieſts, vnſufficiently ſanctified, as well as on the ſecond day? yet for all theſe obiectiones you ſee Hezekiah, in hope to haue things in better order, and in hope of a reformation, againſt the ſecond day, therefore he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected and profaned the firſt day, and made a chang of the day.</p>
                     <p>Others will be redy to obiect thus, why your ſoules neede not pine; for you may haue ſupply the next day, by keeping
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:21140:315"/>Sunday or Lords day alſo, and herein you ſhall haue aſſemblies, and Miniſters both. Herevnto I anſwer. 1. That is more then euer God required, that we ſhould keepe two Sabbaths in one weeke: and alſo it is more then the neceſſity of our caleings will permit. 2. Suppoſe we ſhould keepe the Lords day alſo, yet ſo doeing we ſhould want our daily bread, that is, that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall foode which is appointed of God for that day; we ſhould want our Sabbath daies meales, and ſo all that day long, our ſoules ſhould lacke its refreſhments, and all the Sabbath day long our ſoules ſhould be pineing and languiſhing: wherefore, the ſupplies made vpon the Lords day, will no more helpe for the Sabbath day when it is paſt, then a meales meate on Sunday will comfort a man on Saturday, &amp; ſo much for this obiection; there are other obiections alſo, but I will handle them together in the next Section: and thus much ſhall ſuffice for the proofe of this Diſpenſation.</p>
                     <p>Hauing proued the Diſpenſation, here let me add a reaſon or two, ſhewing why we ſhould the more willingly imbrace it: my firſt reaſon is becauſe it tendeth much vnto <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>concord,</hi> &amp; to containe the members of our Church in vnity: I ſhall not need to ſhew, what diſcord might ariſe, if a rent in practiſe, ſhould be made from our Church: neither ſhall I need to ſhew, what a benefit peace in the Church is; euery man knowes it, euery man cales for it: well then, if it be ſo good to preſerue peace in the Church, let all that are louers of this peace, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all conditiones and helpes which tend vnto peace, if in caſe they be ſuch as may poſſibly be admitted of: I grante it, that for the preſent, wee are fewe in number who are of this contrary iudgement; but ſeeing the caſe is ſo plaine, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, that in Gods good time multituds will be of the ſame iudgement alſo, &amp; then the rent would be grieuouſe to be borne: now it is fit, a wiſe man ſhould haue his eyes in his heade, and foreſee, and preuent an euill: let all that loue therefore the peace of the Church, receiue and imbrace this Diſpenſation, which tendeth to the peace thereof, if poſſiblie it may be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and imbraced; let it haue the moſt charitable and fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſtructiones that may be, that ſo it may ſtand, and ſo the
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:21140:315"/>peace of the Church be maintained &amp; preſerued; where things may be taken in a better ſenſe, and in a worſer ſenſe, therelet the better be choſen. But, <hi>woe is mee,</hi> (as the Prophet Dauid ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) <hi>my ſoule hath too long dwelt with them which hate peace,</hi> I <hi>ſeeke peace, and when</hi> I <hi>ſpeake thereof, they are bent to warre.</hi> Pſ. 120.5.6.7. Neuer did I ſuffer and vndergoe ſuch reproches, and ſuch tauntes, as ſince I haue deliuered this Diſpenſation: my good name hath bene torne into a thowſand peeces; not onely in the Churches and publike places, by <hi>M. Yates,</hi> &amp; <hi>M. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi> charging me with <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> and likening me vnto the <hi>falſe Apostles,</hi> and the like: But alſo, what Table, or priuate meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is there almoſt, wherein my good name hath not bene made odiouſe? thus whilſt I haue ſought peace, with the Church, and with them, they haue raiſed vp ciuill warres againſt mee: now that they might the better make way for my downefale, they haue bene ſo farre from taking things in the better parte, as he is accounted for the moſt excellent, that can vſe the leaſt charity; and he is moſt applauded, that can wreſt my Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the worſt. And ſo much for my firſt reaſon.</p>
                     <p>An other reaſon let me giue you, whereby you may be induced, to conſtrue my diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the better ſenſe &amp; not in the worſe; &amp; to imbrace it, if poſſible it may be; and it is this; that by this Diſpenſation, I doe treade in the footeſtepes of the Apoſtles themſelues: for ſo we ought: <hi>Be yee followers of mee,</hi> ſaith S. Paul 1 Cor. 11.1. For this purpoſe, note how the Apoſtles, had a greate reformation to worke, to wit, the abrogation of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and the Ceremoniall Law, from among the Iewes: Now how behaued they themſelues, in this matter? did they gallop forth poſt-haſt vnto a reformation? did they inſtantly ruinate &amp; aboliſh the vſe of Ceremonies, among beleeuing Iewes? no ſuch matter; but contrariwiſe, they went therevnto in a ſofte walke, according as the times, &amp; conditiones of their people would beare it: and for the preſent, they retayned all the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ſtill in the Church; yea, &amp; they the Apoſtles, vſed theſe ceremonies, together with the people, as you may reade Act. 21.20.21.22.23.24. And they waited for ſeaſon &amp; opportunity to throw downe Ceremonies afterwards; &amp; thus by their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:21140:316"/>they wone many of the Iewes to the faith, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by a raſh &amp; violent courſe they might haue loſt. Iuſt ſo (if this Diſpenſation be imbraced) ſhall we imitate the Apoſtles, in this reformation touching the Sabbath: The Lords day hath bene in vſe a long time, &amp; now in theſe daies it is in greate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: ſo alſo, the Lords Sabbath, hath bene a long time out of vſe, &amp; at this time in diſhonour: and ſo greate is the loue of moſt men vnto the one, &amp; hatred of the other, as cannot eaſily be expreſt: now can it be thought, that the current and ſtreame of the times can be turned in an inſtant? what, before they haue heard on it? for many haue not ſo much as heard of this queſtion: and many that haue heard on it, haue not read it; and ſuch as haue reade it, it is fit they ſhould take a time to deliberate, and to aduiſe about it: now what ſhall wee doe the meane while? ſhall we fale to a preſent practiſe, and ſo rend our ſelues from our bretheren? is this the way to wine them, or to exaſperate them rather? did the Apoſtles rend themſelues, from the beleeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iewes in practiſe? no ſuch matter: <hi>All things are lawfull for m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is expedient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that euery man ſeeke an others wealth and edification, ſo as if poſſibly he may, he diuide not from his brethren in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; but rather to ſeeke their wealth, by holding conformety with them: it is enough that the Doctrine and trueth of the Lords Sabbath is publiſhed, giue it time to roote and to ripen; this foundation being laid, are formation (by God bleſſing) will come off in time the more kindlie: and thus with the Apoſtles we ſhall waite ſeaſon and opportunity, for a happy reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>There are I confeſſe (but they are ſuch as be our aduerſaries in this caſe) who would haue vs in their raſh and inconſiderate zeale, to ruſh violently &amp; inſtantly vpon the practiſe; without all reſpect had firſt vnto our brethren, or to the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we line, or to expediency, ſeaſon, or opportunity, or Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of former times; and theſe men preſſe vs thereto with
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:21140:316"/>this, that it is the Law of God, and a Morall Law, and it is your iudgment, and the like; theſe men would haue the harueſt and the ſeede time both goe together; ſo hote they are: but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing theſe in their indiſcretion and intemperancy, it is ſafer to imitate the Apoſtles, and to take time and leiſure. To conclude, ſince this Diſpenſation, tendeth to the peace of the Church: and alſo imitateth the Apoſtles, let it obtaine the moſt fauourable conſtruction that may be, at leaſt let it not be racked &amp; wreſted vncharitably.</p>

                        <p>Some obiect thus; foraſmuch as I am perſwaded, that the Lords Sabbath is ſtill in force, howbeit I am alſo well perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the trueth of your diſpenſation, yet can I not paſſe ouer the Sabbath when it cometh, profaneing it, &amp; working vpon it, without many &amp; great checkes of conſcience; and much ſorrow of heart, that I ſhould profane the Lords Sabbath; and that too after I know it to be the Lords Sabbath, &amp; ſtill in force by the 4th commandement, thus I am afflicted and pricked in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience euery weeke: now I pray what ſay you to this? is it not a ſinne for me, to goe againſt the checkes of my conſcience? what may I doe in this caſe?</p>
                        <p>For anſwer herevnto, we muſt know, that ſome checkes of conſcience doe ariſe from the doinge of ſomething, which we <hi>ſhould not doe:</hi> and for a man to goe againſt theſe, it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſe and ſinnefull, and a note of an harde heart. Againe, there are ſome checkes of conſcience, which ariſe from the doinge of ſomething which we <hi>would not doe:</hi> and theſe are not alwayes ſinnefull, but are notes of a ſofte heart, and tender conſcience; for they would not doe the things they doe, if it were in their power to amend them. I will cleere this caſe by ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: it is lawfull for a man to fly for his life, his enemy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing him, vpon the Sabbath day: and it is lawfull for a man to worke, in quenching of a fyer on the Sabbath day: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:21140:317"/>a ſofte heart, and tender conſcience, will be full of prickings in the time of his flight, and whilſt he is at worke: Now the reaſon hereof is, not becauſe theſe his actions are ſinefull, but becauſe he doth what he would not doe vpon this day, if it could be auoided; and becauſe he neglecteth the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſeruice of God all that time, which he would much rather haue bene imployed about. Furthermore, Dauid, when he eat the Sewbread, it could not but grieue him, that he was caſt vpon ſuch neceſſity, as that he muſt eate that, which was not lawfull for him to eate. And Dauid, when he ſpared the life of Ioab, which he ſhould haue taken away, it could not but be a corziue to his conſcience, ſo often as he ſaw that murtherer liue. And the Apoſtles, when they obſerued thoſe things commanded in the Ceremoniall Law, in circumciſing, &amp; ſhauing the head, and the like, they knowing that theſe things were aboliſhed, they could not but doe it with checking and vnquiet conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ſome reſpect: and yet theſe were not euill conſciences, nor theſe actiones ſinnes, but they were markes of ſoftened heartes and tender conſciences: and ſo is it with the checkes in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which we cannot but haue, in ſome reſpectes, ſo often as we neglect the Lords Sabbath: they are notes of ſoft heartes &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſciences, plainly bewraying, that we would much rather Sanctify the Lords Sabbath, if it were in our power.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, whereas you asked me, what you ſhould doe in this caſe: I anſwer, euen all you can doe, to the vtmoſt of your power, to get out of this neceſſity, that ſo you may haue your hearts deſire in ſanctification of the Lords Sabbaths: for no man will lay ſtill vnder a neceſſity, any longer then he needs muſt: a poore man will get out of his pouerty; a ſicke man out of his ſickneſſe; a priſoner out of priſon, with all the ſpeed they may. Now the way to get out of our neceſſity is this, to labour a generall reformation; and that, firſt by inſtant &amp; conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer to God: and next, by divulging this trueth of God, as farre as thin occationes and caleing will permit; that ſo it may rune from man to man, till at length it may come vnto the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, whoſe office it is to make reformation, and ſo to looſen thee from thy neceſſity of profaning the Lords Sabbaths any longer.</p>

                        <p> Indeed it is fit we ſhould haue prickes, and checkes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, all the time we lay in the neglect of the Lords Sabbaths, that ſo we may be thereby often rowſed vp, to vſe all good meanes poſſible and ſpeedily for a reformation: If God ſhould let vs bequiet in minde, we would grow ſecure with this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, ſit downe, and take our eaſe, neuer careing what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of Gods ſacred Sabbaths, nor when a reformation were made.</p>

                        <p>Some who are enemies to Gods Sabbaths, and friends to the Lords day, argue thus; foraſmuch as the Lords day, may be kept for a Sabbath ſtill, by virtue of this Diſpenſation, why ſhould we trouble our ſelues? for we haue that alredy: let vs keepe vs where we are ſtill, for we are well enough.</p>
                        <p>But herevnto I anſwer, that you are not well enough: &amp; for the diſcouery of this, you muſt note, for whom this Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, &amp; vnto whom it doth properly belonge: for it belongeth not vnto all men: this Diſpenſation therefore is made, for ſuch as are perſwaded, that the Sabbath day is ſtill in force, and therefore doe make a conſcience of it; who in a caſe of neceſſity, may keepe the Lords day for it, for a ſeaſon, vntill a time of reformation: But this Diſpenſation, is not made at all, for our newe Sabbatharians, who make no conſcience of the old Sabbath: for to what end ſhould they haue a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the old Sabbath, who make no conſcience at all of it?</p>
                        <p>In the Diſpenſation, it is allowed for men to keepe the new Sabbath, or Lords day, for the old Sabbath, and in ſteade of it for a ſeaſon; which doth imply, that they had rather keepe the old Sabbath then the newe; &amp; that they haue a conſcience of the old Sabbath ſtill; and that the Lords day is not kept for it ſelfe ſake, but for the Sabbaths ſake; ſo that it is the Sabbath, that hath all the reſpect and honour; &amp; the Lords day hath none as for it ſelfe: Now our new Sabbatharians, will not keepe the Lords day ſtill, in this ſenſe: but if they will take any aduantage from our Diſpenſation, and from our keeping the Lords day with them, they muſt keepe it in this ſenſe, for in this ſenſe the old
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:21140:318"/>Sabbathatians doe keepe the Lords day: we honour the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, as our King; and we eſteeme the Lords day in its roome, but as a deputy, that for the time occupieth the place of the King, and whom we honour not for his owne ſake, but for the Kings whoſe place he poſſeſſeth: ſo we honour the Lords day for the Sabbath daies ſake which went laſt before the Lords day; and in roome whereof the Lords day ſtands as a deputy for the preſent neceſſity. 2. Wee can by virtue of this Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, keepe the Lords day, in conſcience of, and obedience vnto the 4th commandement; but you cannot keepe the Lords day in obedience vnto the 4th commandement: holding ſtill your owne grownds, and reiecting the Sabbath day. 3. Whereas you ſay you are well enough, and will keepe you where you are ſtill: then know, that your good and contentfull condition wherein you reſt, it is no better then Popiſh ſuperſtition; if you thinke hereby to pleaſe God, in obedience vnto his 4th com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
                        <p>To conclud, let no man flatter himſelfe, in his keeping the Lords day, or new Sabbath, becauſe we old Sabbatharians doe keepe it with them: for we keepe it in one ſenſe, and they in an other; we iuſtify our keeping of it, but they can neuer iuſtify their owne keeping of it, holding ſtill their old grownds and opiniones of it: we ſo keepe the Lords day with them, as for all that, we renownce it for Gods Sabbath, and to haue any Diuine inſtitution; if any therefore will take aduantage from this Diſpenſation, or incouragment from our keeping the Lords day, they muſt keepe it in our ſenſe, as we keepe it and eſteeme of it.</p>

                        <p>I anſwer, we ſay not onely that we keepe the Lords day in roome of the Sabbath, but this we add, that we keepe it in roome
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:21140:318"/>of the Sabbath, by way of a change, for the Sabbath: now here they leaue vs, they will not ſay they keepe the Lords day for the Sabbath day ſake, for ſo they ſhould renownce the Lords day, and not keepe it for it ſelfe ſake: Albeit we keepe the Lords Supper in roome of the Paſſeouer yet we keepe it not for the Paſſeouer ſake, but for its on owne ſake: or elſe we ſhould aduance the Paſſeouer aboue the Lords Supper, and ſo it ſhould not be regarded for it ſelfe ſake. For example, when the old King is dead, then the new King his heier, rules in his roome and place; and we obey the new King in ſtead of the old, but for his owne ſake not for the old Kings ſake; and in this ſenſe they keepe the new Sabbath in roome of the old Sabbath, ſuppoſing the old Sabbath to be deade, &amp; therefore they keepe the Lords day for it ſelfe ſake not for the Sabbaths ſake: But it is otherwiſe with vs; for when the King goeth to the warres into ſome forraine Land, and leaueth a deputy or viceroy to gouerne in his roome, we obey this deputy in the roome indeed of the King, but not for his owne ſake, but for the Kings ſake; and ſo wee keepe the Lords day for a time, in roome of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but for the Sabbaths ſake, not for its owne ſake.</p>

                        <p>Some argue thus, foraſmuch as thoſe which ſtand ſo ſtrongly for the old Sabbath, doe profane and neglect it themſelues, and doe by this Diſpenſation iuſtify it as warrantable; therefore what neede wee to take any care at all of it? why ſhould we make any ſcruples of conſcience about it? why ſhould we feare to profane it, and to worke on it? and why ſhould we be in doubt of tranſgreſſion of the 4th commandement by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting it?</p>
                        <p>Herevnto I anſwer, greate is the difference, betwixt our profanation and neglect of the Sabbath day, and the profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and neglect of it by our new Sabbatharians; and therefore it followeth not that they may prophane it, as well as we, and as ſafely; for we doe profane it in griefe of heart, like as Dauid did breake the Law of the Shew-bread; and, did ſuffer Ioab to liue; and, as the Apoſtles did vſe and retaine Ceremonies among beleeuers, after they were aboliſhed; and, as a man laboureth to

Whilſt we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane this day, we freely giue God an other day for it, by way of exchange, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did: &amp; hereby it appeareth, that whilſt we profane it by bodily labour in a caſe of neceſſity, we doe reuerence it, &amp; honour it highly in our heartes. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, theſe new Sabbatharians, they doe profane the Sabbath without any reſpect had vnto neceſſity; they profane it volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily: for they take no griefe of heart, at their working on the Sabbath day; neither doe they wiſh it were otherwiſe, and that there were a reformation; neither doe they giue God an other day for the Sabbath day, but they keepe the Lords day for it ſelfe onely, hateing Gods Sabbath: and therefore vaine is their arguing, to ſay, they may as well neglect the Sabbath day as we doe. Let them know, that if our neglect were a ſinne, it were but a ſinne of frailty, but their neglect of it, is a ſinne with an high hand; our were but a ſinne againſt our wiles, but theirs is a ſinne vvith full conſent of will, nay ours is no ſinne; for 1. we giue God an other day for it. 2. vve profane it but in a caſe of neceſſity onely, as Dauid did eate the Shew-bread, and as men quench an howſe on ſier on the Sabbath: But on the contrary theires is a ſinne: for they prophane Gods Sabbaths willingly, neuer reſpecting any neceſsity at all. VVherefore, let not them beare themſelues vpon vs, nor thinke to worke vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, as well as we doe, vnleſſe they did it with the ſame minde that vve doe it vvith.</p>
                        <p>You know the Iſraelites went thorough the Red Sea ſafely; for they had a warrant from God ſo to doe; but the Egyptians following them, thinking they might as well goe thorough as they, were drowned. Let no man ſooth vp &amp; flatter himſelfe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, thinking hee may worke on the Sabbath, becauſe wee doe worke on it; for it may coſt him deere to follow vs, vnleſſe he be of the ſame iudgment vvith vs. I verily perſwade my ſelfe, that many a man cozeneth himſelfe, taking heart &amp; courage, to liue ſtill in the vvant of reformation, either of his iudgment or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe in this point, becauſe he ſeeth vs to neglect the keeping of the Sabbath day; but let him be admoniſhed in time; I dare

                        <p>Some happily may obiect thus; it ſeemeth to vs, that Sabbath breaking is a fearefull ſinne, whilſt we reade your expoſition vpon the 4th commandement: But now ſince we haue reade your Diſpenſation, it ſeemeth but a light matter; becauſe a man may liue in the weekly breach thereof, and yet iuſtify it too.</p>
                        <p>Herevnto I anſwer, I account the ſinne of Sabbath breaking heere, no leſſe heinouſe &amp; fearefull, then I accounted it there: for it doth not follow, that becauſe there is a Diſpenſation from a commandement, in a caſe of neceſſity, that therefore the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of that commandement, when there is no neceſſity, is a light matter: A Diſpenſation indeed, maketh the breach of that commandement light, for that time, and to thoſe perſons vnto whom the Diſpenſation doth properly belong; as the eating of the Sewbread in a caſe of neceſſity, it was for that time light, and vnto Dauid in hunger, it was light; but yet at other times, and to ſuch perſons as were not in Dauids caſe at that time, it had bene an heinouſe and a fearefull ſinne, to haue eaten of that bread: and thus it is with the Sabbath, whilſt there is a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in a caſe of neceſſity, and to thoſe perſones vnto whom it doth belong, it is light: neuertheleſſe, out of this caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Diſpenſation, to breake the Sabbath it is an heinouſe and a fearefull ſinne: now in the expoſition of the 4th commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there we conſidered of the Sabbath day, out of the caſe of neceſſity, and ſo it is to be conſidered, vnto all ſuch as are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnto it: and to them it is an heinouſe and fearefull ſinne, to profane it by working on it, like as it had bene a greate ſinne, for Dauid himſelfe, to haue eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Shewbread, out of the caſe of hunger: but in the Diſpenſation, there we conſider of the Sabbath; as in a caſe of neceſſity, and ſo it is to be conſidered onely vnto ſuch as make a conſcience of it, and are true friends

Wherefore to conclude, when the breach of the Sabbath, is to be eſteemed light, then it is to be conſidered as light, onely vnto the true friends thereof, but not vnto the enemies thereof; let not them therefore take heart hereat, as if God meant to fauour them: for their Sabbath breaking, is neuer a whit leſſened or lightened from being vnto them, an heinouſe and a fearefull ſinne, by the Diſpenſation granted vnto others.</p>

And for the profe hereof the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:21140:320"/>of Peter is alleaged, Gal. 2.12.13. And ſo we are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for Hypocriſy as Peter was.</p>
                        <p>For a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer hereto, firſt we muſt know what Hypocriſy is: Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy therefore in the common ſenſe of the word, is when a man doth make ſemblance &amp; ſhew, to be that which in deede and in trueth he is not; his outward appearance being one thing, but his home and inward practiſe being an other. In this ſenſe our Sauiour denounceth a woe vnto the Scribes and Phariſes, caling them Hypocrits, becauſe they made cleane the outer ſide of the Cupp and Platter, but within they were full of bribery and exceſſe: and becauſe they were like to whited Tombes, which appeare beautifull outwardly, but within they were full of dead mens bones, and filthineſſe: and becauſe outwardly they appeared righteouſe to men, but within were full of iniquity Mat. 23.25. &amp;c. Now this diſcription of Hypocriſy, we are as free from it in this our practiſe, as they are that taxe vs with it: for where can they ſhew that we vſe any of this Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call guile and diſsimulation, making a faire ſhew outwardly, of that which we practiſe not indeed &amp; in trueth? if indeed we did outwardly profeſſe, that we kept the Sabbath day in our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, but when theſe men that ſo taxe vs, come amongſt vs, they ſee no ſuch matter; then they might taxe vs for Hypocriſy: but behold the quite contrary; for we openly, fairly, and honeſtly profeſſe it, that in our iudgements we hold, we are not bound vnto the preſent practiſe, as the caſe ſtandeth: now according to this our open ſhew, appearance, and profeſsion, iuſt ſo is our practiſe at home; for we keep not the Sabbath day, but the Lords day, let them taxe vs if they can: where then is this Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall diſſembling? where is this guilfull dealing, wherewithall they taxe vs ſo ſorely before the people in their Pulpits? can any men deale more fairly then we doe? for our words and our deeds goe togeather. It is a rule in Diuinity, that if a brothers actiones may admit of a double ſenſe, the better ſenſe is to be giuen; but ſuer I am, theſe men were farre from the practiſe of this rule of charity, whilſt ſo vncharitably they haue giuen the worſer ſenſe, yea a falſe ſenſe: ſo farre off they are from charritable conſtructiones, as they haue ſtretcht their wites

                        <p>Furthermore, we cannot be cenſured with Hypocriſy, if they looke but vpon our iudgements, which we haue formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to them: for we openly profeſſe it and ſo euer haue done, that we thinke in our conſciences, that a Diſpenſation is good in our caſe; and that we are not bound vnto the preſent practiſe, dureing this caſe of neceſsity: now ſuppoſe, that this our iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were erroniouſe, and that there ought to be no Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet, ſo long as we doe indeed, thinke and beleeue, that we may refraine the practiſe; ſo long (at the worſt) we can be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured but for an errour of frailty, &amp; for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p> Laſtly, let vs ſee how fitly they haue alleaged the example, of Peters Hypocriſy againſt vs Gal. 2.12.13. For this purpoſe note, that Peter did eate of prohibited meates, with the Gentiles; and ſo for a time, liued as the Gentiles, as the text ſpeaketh: But after a time, vpon the coming of ſome Iewes into their aſſembly, Peter for feare of them, refrained, and would no longer eate of thoſe vncleane meates: now for that Peter did thus through feare, withdraw himſelfe, from his former practiſe with the Gentiles, &amp; ſo drew other of the aſſemby after him to Iudaiſme, from the practiſe of Chriſtianiſme; therefore Paul taxed him with Hypocriſy, as you may ſee Gal. 2.11. &amp;c. Now here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lay his Hypocriſy, that vnto the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who were newly come into the Chriſtian Aſſembly, Peter made ſhew in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, as if he had retained Iudaiſme ſtill: for he refuſed to eate with the Gentiles; howbeit indeed and in trueth he had forſaken Iudaiſme; for he had eaten with the Gentiles vntill their coming, and had ſo done ſtill, had it not bene for feare of them. Againe, he bewrayed Hypocriſy toward the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for vntill theſe Iewes came into the Aſſembly, Peter made ſhew, as if he had renownced Iewiſh ceremonies; for he did eate vncleane meates with the Gentiles; but no ſooner were a fewe Iewes come in amongſt them, but inſtantly for feare of them, Peter withdrawes himſelfe, and will no longer eate with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, whereby he bewraies that he had not renownced Iewiſh ceremonies: ſo that Peter vſed Hypocriſy both with Iewes, and with Gentiles: now can <hi>M.

It is generally holden, that to ſanctify one day of ſeauen for Gods worſhip is morall, as the Lords day euery weeke, &amp; yet they will not deny a diſpenſation from this in ſome caſe, as in caſe of neceſſity, when an howſe is on fyer, and when an enemy makes an aſſault vpon one of our Cities &amp;c.

Finally, why a diſpenſation ſhould not be in a morall as well as in a ceremoniall, they haue yeelded no reaſon, nor doe I thinke they can.</p>

                     <p>WE haue now done with the Diſpenſation; and according to promiſe, we are to end with an Exhortation: now it is very requiſit, that an exhortation vnto reformation, ſhould be added to the Diſpenſation, leaſt that peraduenture, lazie ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and ſpirituall ſlouthfulneſſe, ſhould poſſeſſe the ſoules of ſome men, thinking all is well enough; ſince we haue a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation touching the practiſe, we neede not put forwards vnto a reformation: for the preuention whereof, and alſo for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragment of all men feareing God, to put forwards vnto a deſired Reformation, I haue added a fewe reaſones and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues.</p>
                     <p>But happily ſome may aske of me, what it is I would that they ſhould doe in this caſe; for may they ſay, we are priuate perſones &amp;c. &amp; I am but one &amp;c. &amp; what can we doe? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I anſwer, it is true indeed, that Reformation muſt begine at the head His <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> the Reuerend <hi>Biſhopes,</hi> and <hi>Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> are they that cane doe this greate worke; Neuertheleſſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſones, and ſingle perſones may be helpers: The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter builder layes the ſtone, but inferiour perſones hewe the ſtone, and ſingle perſones carry ſtone to the building. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enacteth Lawes, yet often and againe, thoſe Lawes take their originall in the Country, from priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones, and ſingle perſones, who foreſeeing the neceſſity of ſuch Lawes, acquainting their brethren therewith, they rune from man to man, till at length they come to the King himſelfe. All therefore I deſire thee, as a priuate perſon to doe is but this; firſt, pray to God inſtantly and conſtantly, to make knowne this doctrine of his Sabbath, to all perſones, and ſo in time vnto his Maieſtie, and other Reformers vnder him: and that God would incline both His and all mens hearts, vnto a publike and
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:21140:323"/>generall Reformation; Secondly, vſe all meanes poſſible within the compaſſe of thy caleing, that may any waies tend vnto a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; to this end, after thou haſt well ſtudied the pointe, then ſpeake of it freely, as occation ſerueth, vnto all whom it doth concerne: let the Lords Sabbaths haue thy good word, let them haue thy countenance, and all poſſible furtherance, that ſo the light of this trueth, may be conveighed from man to man vntill it be ſpread all ouer the Kingdome, &amp; vntill it hath reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the Pallace of the King, and Parliament houſe.</p>
                     <p>When the Lords <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was to be made, euery one of a wiling heart, brought ſomething therevnto; ſome brought <hi>gold</hi> &amp; <hi>ſiluer;</hi> ſome <hi>blew ſilke</hi> &amp; <hi>ſkarlet;</hi> ſome <hi>oyle</hi> for the light; ſome <hi>rammes ſkines;</hi> and <hi>badgers ſkinnes;</hi> ſo euery one would haue an hand in that gloriouſe and ſacred worke. Now the Lords <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths</hi> are to be reedified, let euery one bring ſomething there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto; and if they cannot afford gold and ſiluer, yet let them bring ſomething, a ſkine or two, or a little oyle for the light: a man cannot afford God, and his cauſe, leſſe then his good word, and countenance; and his good word, may proue as oyle for the light; for it may procure much light: this is all which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of priuate perſones; and thus they may ſerue very vſefully for the Lords building, as hewers of ſtone for the building; or as bearers of ſtone to the Maſter builders; or as oyle for the light: and this is all I deſire of ſingle perſones, who ſay I am but one &amp;c. why one may light a Candle, which may giue light vnto twenty; and one may kindle a fyer, that may warme a greate many, and ſo much for common perſones.</p>
                     <p>Further, we muſt know this Exhortation concerneth not onely common perſons, but it reacheth vnto the very chiefe: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto Laiety and Clergy both: it concerneth common Miniſters neerly, but it concerneth the Byſhopes and Fathers of the Church more neerly, it concerneth the Commons of the land neerly, but it concerneth the Gentrie and Nobilitie more neerly; and his Maieſtie moſt neerly: for by how much God hath aduanced any in Authority aboue others, by ſo much this Reformation more neerly concerneth them or him: and in caſe they neglect it, the greater account they ſhall haue to render
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:21140:323"/>vnto God at that day. The 4th com, it was (as hath been ſhowne) moſt principally giuen vnto Superiours &amp;c.

                        <p>In the firſt place, we will conſider of the <hi>greatneſſe,</hi> and ſo of the <hi>difficulty,</hi> of this reformation, that ſo many men may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to put too their helpe. Since the daies of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call to minde, that euer the Church of God, made any refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, comparable to this of the Lords Sabbaths; vnleſſe it were that one remarkable reformation; touching the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, begune by that worthy inſtrument of Gods glorie, <hi>Martine Luther,</hi> if the euill eye of the inviouſe man, will giue me leaue to ſay ſo.</p>
                        <p>The greatneſſe whereof may appeare. 1. Becauſe it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all men without exception: for there is no man liuing in the Church, but the obſeruation of the Sabbath concerneth him, and that in a ſpeciall ſorte.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It will be the greater, becauſe it hath layne buried now, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute twelue hundreth yeeres; euen ſince that wicked and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall decree, of the Counſaile of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Anno 364, which rente the Churches a ſunder one from an other, the younger, from the more ancient and pure Churches, as touching the obſeruation of the Lords Sabbaths. Now an old ſore is not eaſily cured: the myracle of Chriſt, was the greater vpon <hi>Lazarus,</hi> becauſe he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead, when he had bene ſo long buried, that he ſtank againe: the Lords Sabbaths haue bene now ſo long dead and buried, that they ſtinke againe in mens noſtriles, through their want of a true Sente, the reuiuing and raiſing of them vp againe therefore, will be a worke of greate difficulty.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It will be the greater, becauſe it is like to meete with mighty and greate oppoſitiones: for what greate worke was euer attempted, that had not as greate oppoſitiones? when the <hi>Wales</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> were builded, what oppoſitiones? and when the <hi>Temple</hi> was reedified, what opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="612" facs="tcp:21140:324"/>at the reedifying and raiſing vp againe of the <hi>Lords Sabbaths,</hi> there will be no ſmale oppoſitiones: Now greate workes, and difficult workes, as they ſtand in neede of the helpe of greate men; ſo they neede the helpe of many men; to one Captaine or Generall, there are hundreths and thowſands of common ſoldiers: it is needfull therefore, that euery priuate man, ſhould put to his hand, and his voyce, for the reedifying of the Lords Sabbaths; and by how much the more difficult, by ſo much the more neede there is, of a generall aſſiſtance, and the aide of all men.</p>

                        <p>In the ſecond place, we will conſider of the <hi>Honourableneſse</hi> of this reformation: and this will appeare, by the Honourableneſſe of the thing to be reformed, to wit, the Lords Sabbath: tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which, firſt we will conſider of its <hi>antiquity:</hi> this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Gods Sabbath, of all others, it is one of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; for it is of the age of the world; it being inſtituted at the Creation Geneſ. 2.3. If therefore the honourableneſſe, may be valued by the antiquity, what can be more honourable? for nothing is more ancient: who would not haue an hand and a voyce, in the raiſing vp againe, of ſo ancient and honourable an ordinance of Gods, as is his ſacred Sabbath?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we will conſider of its conſtant obſeruation, a longe all times and ages, from before the giuing of the Law vpon Mount Sinay, vntill 300 or 400 yeeres after Chriſts aſcention: for as we haue formerly proued: the Sabbath day was in vſe in the Church, before the giuing of the Law; and ſo alſo it was in vſe, after the giuing of the Law, vntill Chriſt: yea, and it was in vſe in the daies of the Apoſtles, by the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues after Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>: and alſo it was in vſe in the primitiue Churches after Chriſt, for 300 or 400 yeeres, euen ſo long as the Church retained its beſt purity; and vntill corruptiones and popery begane to creepe in: now if we ſhall value the honour of the Sabbath day, by the honourable eſtimation, that the Church of God had conſtantly for thowſands of yeeres of it before Chriſt; and if we ſhall eſteeme of its honour, by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable eſtimation, which the <hi>Chriſtian Churches</hi> had of it, for
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:21140:324"/>neere 400 yeeres after Chriſt, then doubtleſſe the Sabbath is an honourable thing: and the reformation of it will be no leſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable: and who vvould not put hand and voyce, to ſuch an honourable reformation?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, we will conſider how <hi>Almightie God</hi> hath honoured it: this will appeare in theſe particulares 1. God honoured it by, his owne obſeruation of it, at the Creation: for God himſelfe reſted vpon the Sabbath day Geneſ. 2.3. 2dly, God honoured this day and time aboue all daies and times, in that he bleſſed, hallowed, and ſanctified this day, as we reade Geneſ. 2.3. Exod. 20.11. and ſo made it an <hi>Holy day.</hi> 3dly, God honoured this day, by commanding it by his owne immediate voyce, vpon Mount Sinay; and by placeing it amongſt the other Morales; and giuing it there alſo an eminent and chiefe place; for hee put it into the firſt Table of the Decalogue; and after that, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it carefully to be laid vp and preſerued in the Arke, with the other Morales. 4thly God honoured this day, by taking it vnto himſelfe in a ſpeciall ſorte, caling it his day, as <hi>myne holy day,</hi> Iſa. 58.13. And, <hi>the Sabbath of the Lord</hi> Exod. 20.10. whence it is caled the Lords Sabbath, Emphatically.</p>
                        <p>VVherefore, ſince God reſted on this day, let vs indeauour a reformation, that we his children alſo may reſt on this day: and ſince God hallowed and ſanctified this day, let vs vſe all good meanes, that we may hallow and ſanctify this day alſo: &amp; ſince God deliuered this day by liuely voyce; let vs vſe our toungs &amp; voyces for it: and ſince God placed it amongſt the other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales, &amp; ſet it eminently in the firſt Table; let not vs ſuffer it to be thruſt out amongſt the Ceremonies; and ſeing God gaue it an high place in the Morall Law; let not vs ſuffer it to be thruſt quite out of place, ſo as now it ſhould haue no place at all in the Morall Law: whers your courage? whers your zeale for God, if you can indure theſe things? If Chriſtian men, loue to haue their hands in an honourable worke, then let them caſt aſide ſhame, and feare, and ſuch like carnall affectiones; and let them armed with courage and zeale, ſpeake for God, and defend his Sabbaths, and cale for a reformation: the worke is honourable; for it is honoured with <hi>Antiquity;</hi> &amp; with the conſtant practiſe
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:21140:325"/>of Gods Church, &amp; that alſo of the <hi>pureſt</hi> &amp; primitiue Church; and with ſpeciall honour done vnto it, by Almighty God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                        <p>Yet further, this Sabbath is in Scripture expreſly called an <hi>Holy day: To morrow is the Reſt of the Holy Sabbath vnto the Lord</hi> Exod. 16.23. Iſa. 58.13. and one reaſon thereof may be, becauſe at the Creation, God bleſſed it and ſanctified it, Geneſ. 2.2.3. And ſo made it an Holy day. Now no day of all the 7, no not the <hi>Lords day,</hi> was euer ſanctified by God, or caled an Holy day. Yea, God had many anniuerſary <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> as we read in Leuit. 23. Yet doe we not read, that euer God <hi>bleſſed</hi> &amp; <hi>ſanctified</hi> any of them, as he did this Sabbath of the 7th day, So highly God honoured it. This difference therefore of this day from others, is as the difference of Sacramentall bread from common bread and as was the ſacred Temple from common howſen, and who would not labour the reedifying, of ſuch an holy and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing?</p>

                        <p>In the third place, we will conſider of the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: and here, If vntill a reformation be made, diuerſe &amp; ſondry verſes of the holy Scripture, yea in the 10 commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be as ſo many verſes rent out of the Scripture, or quite blotted out of the booke of God, or ſtand but as ſo many Ciphers: And alſo, the Decalogue or Morall lawe, is not taught, and maintained in our Church, nor in any Chriſtian Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſids, in its integrity and perfection, but onely lamely and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medly. If vntill a reformation, the whole 4th commandement, is vtterly and wholly aboliſhed, both roote and branch. If vntill a reformation be made, the Land and Kingdome wherein we liue, with all other Chriſtian Churches, doe liue in the weekly profanation of the Lords Sabbaths, and tranſgreſsion of the 4th commandement. If I ſhall ſhewe vnto you, that vntill a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation be made, we ſanctify a common and profane day, and profane a ſanctified and holy day: And Gods worſhip will lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and profaneſſe inuade vs: And that a Romiſh Relique is honoured in ſtead of an ordinance of Gods: And that Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is daily neglected: yea and corrupted: with many other

If I ſhall proue vnto you, that vntill a reformation, the ſinne of Idolatry is committed by many in the Land: if (I ſay) I ſhall make theſe things plainly appeare vnto you, then I truſt you wil ſay with me, that it is high time, that euery man lay too his helping hand for a reformation, &amp; that ſpeedily.</p>

That the Lords day is a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, you may remember I haue formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it, and that by the Teſtimonies of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchthon,</hi> of <hi>Hemingius,</hi> and out of the <hi>Harmonie of Confeſſions.</hi> 2. It muſt needs be a tradition &amp; no better: for the inſtitution of it, is no where found in the Holy Scriptures, as hath bene ſhowne, and therefore it muſt be ſuppoſed, to be ordeined by the Fathers, or to come vnto vs, from the Apoſtles, by ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Tradition of the Church; or elſe it muſt haue a worſe originall: Thus you ſee the Lords day is a Tradition, or worſe: giue it its due, and it is an old Tradition, newly furbuſhed &amp; trimmed vp: or an old Tradition, cullered &amp; painted ouer with Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Now that it is a Popiſh Tradition, and Romiſh Relique, I thus proue it; becauſe there being no grownd for it in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet for all that the patrones of it, doe vrge &amp; preſſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of it, as a neceſſary thing, as tying me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s conſciences, &amp; vpon paine of damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: now for any to vrge indifferent things, not found in the Scriptures, vpon paine of damnation, is Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and Popiſh: Neither let this ſeeme ſtrange vnto any, that I call it a Romiſh and popiſh Tradition: for the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>It may be it will be ſaid, that Popiſh Traditiones come vnto vs, as is holden, from the Apoſtles, by the practiſe and allowance of the Fathers: but we hold the Lords day, to come from the
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:21140:327"/>the Apoſtles, by the Scriptures, by force of neceſſary &amp; ſound conſequence &amp;c. Herevnto I anſwer, for my parte I can ſee no difference betwene theſe two, vnleſſe it be that our caſe is the worſer, and the Tradition the better: for what wiſe man, would not as much reley vpon the Fathers, as vpon their vaine conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences? or more honour the Authority of the Fathers, then theſe mens friuolouſe conſequences?

                        <p>This is that point, for the diſcouery whereof I haue ſuffred ſo much: they ſay indeed I will ſuffer nothing, and therefore haue made a Diſpenſation, but they ſay amiſſe: At my firſt diſcouery of it, I ſaid no worſe of it then thus, that there is no warrant for the Lords day Sabbath in the Scriptures, &amp; therefore I durſt not preach for it, if I might gaine 500 l. I did not deliuer this my iudgement in Pulpit, but onely in priuate to 3 or 4 of my inward friends: Now for this, I was cenſured by ſome godly &amp; religiouſe Miniſters, to be vnworthie of the place, I then inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and hereupon the Gentleman of whom I did depend, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed me of my place: it is now more then fowre yeeres ſince, all this time I haue ſuffred with my family greate want, for the want of that my maintenance, and for ought I can foreſee, ſo am like to liue and ſo to dye: But if now, it be found that I was in the trueth, and thoſe godly and religiouſe Miniſters in the errour, will not all men ſay, they are bound in conſcience to make me amends, by a reſtitution of my loſſe? I demand it of them by theſe preſents: without reſtitution repentance is vnſound: the cries of the oppreſſed are entred into the eares of the Lord of Hoſtes.</p>

                        <p>Furthermore, I ſhall ſhew vnto you, that vntill a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cometh; Gods worſhip is daily neglected amongſt vs. By a daily neglct, I meane an euery 7th daies neglect; or a neglect euery day when the Sabbath cometh.

                        <p>Now tell me, if it be not time to ſeeke a reformation, when God is denied his worſhip, due vnto his Honour yea, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it weekly too: yea, and a principall parte of his worſhip:

Cor. 6.17.18. This exhortation, we may fitly apply vnto this purpoſe: the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhee liueth ſtill in the neglect and corruption of Gods worſhip, both in the dueties of the ſecond commandement, and alſo in the dueties of the fowrth commandement, for ſhee neglecteth and denieth God alſo, the worſhip of his Sabbaths to this day: now as ſaieth the Apoſtle, <hi>what communion hath light with darkneſse?</hi> 1 Cor. 6.14. This Romiſh Church, ſhee lieth ſtill in ignorance, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and darkneſſe touching this parte of Gods worſhip, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the 4th commandement, as well as in that other parte of his worſhip, preſcribed in the 2th commandement, now ſince we will haue no fellowſhip with hir, in hir darkneſſe, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ignorance touching the 2th com. why ſhould we haue any communion with hir, in hir darkneſſe, blindneſſe, and ignorance touching the 4th commandement? The principall and immediate worſhip of God, is conteined in iiij commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the firſt Table: now the Church of Rome, hath diuided with God, and ij of them, ſhee yeeldeth God, and the other ij ſhee robbeth him of moſt ſacrilegiouſly: ſhee giueth God thoſe partes of his worſhip, conteined in the firſt, and third comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, but ſhee denieth God thoſe other partes of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, conteined in the ſecond, and fowrth commandements; well, we haue happily forſaken hir, in hir corruptiones of the 2d commandement, let vs alſo forſake and departe from hir, in the corruption of the 4th commandement: let vs come out

                        <p>I come now vnto that other thing forementioned; to wit, that vntill a time of reformation, God is not purely worſhiped, for his worſhip is corrupted amongſt vs: And this ſhall appeare by this, that the Lords day, which by Gods ordinance in his 4th commandement, is appointed for a working day, it is by many brought into the worſhip of God, and ſanctified by virtue of the 4th commandement.</p>
                        <p>It is a poore ſhifte that ſome make; ſaying, we keepe not the Lords day now, as a parte of the worſhip of God, as the Iewes did the Sabbath day: For, 1 ſince we hold that the Lords day, is kept in roome of the Sabbath day, as the Lords Supper is kept in the roome of the Paſſeouer; it muſt needs follow, that foraſmuch as the Sabbath day whilſt it ſtood, was a parte of Gods worſhip, that ſo in like manner, the Lords day, muſt be a parte of Gods worſhip alſo: for it ſtands in the place of that which was a parte of Gods worſhip. 2. If we will keepe the Lords day, by virtue of the 4th commandement, then it muſt of neceſſity be kept as a parte of Gods worſhip: for, what is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in obedience to any of the 4 precepts of the firſt Table, that muſt needs be the worſhip of God: becauſe the dueties therein contained, are the worſhip of God.</p>
                        <p>It is to be noted, that the Lords day, it is by Gods ordinance in his 4th commandement a working day; for God himſelfe wrought on it, at the Creation, it being the firſt day of the world; and by his exemplary working on it, hee ſet vs a pattorne that we ſhould doe the like. Yea to his example, he gaue vs his precept for it, ſaying, Sixe daies ſhalt thou labour &amp;c. Now the Lords day, is the firſt day of thoſe Sixe, and therefore alſo a working day. Yea further, God did not hallow, bleſſe, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Lords day, as hee did the Sabbath day Geneſ. 2.3. So that this Lords day, it is a profane, vnhallowed, and vnſanctified day; like vnto the other 5 working daies of the weeke. Yet further, Chriſt himſelfe, and his Diſciples, made it a trauailing
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:21140:330"/>day; and neuer made it a Sabbath day, wherefore it is but a common day: now for any man, to aduance this common and vnhallowed day, and place it in the firſt Table of the Decalogue, amidſt and amongſt the partes of Gods worſhip; and then to ſanctify it and conſecrate it vnto God, by virtue of his 4th com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, it is to pollute the holy worſhip of God, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane things: and they that ſo vſe it, doe worſhip God impurly and corruptly: as well might thoſe profane perſones, whom our Sauiour whipt out of the Temple, for buying and ſelling there, bring their <hi>doues,</hi> &amp; <hi>wares</hi> into the <hi>Temple</hi> to ſell there, as in a common market, Mark. 11.15. As theſe may bring the <hi>Lords day,</hi> into the firſt Table, and worſhip of God.

                        <p>Yet further, if I ſhall make it appeare, that multitudes (I doe not ſay all) are guilty of Idolatry, vntill a Reformation cometh; then you will ſay with me it is high time indeed, to ſeeke for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. For this purpoſe, you muſt know, that there is as well a puritane Idolatry, as a Popiſh Idolatry: for, as when A Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix, the Breaden God, the Images of Chriſt, the virgine Mary, &amp; the reſt, come in preſence, inſtantly Papiſts vncouer the head, and performe much honour in reſpect of them: So, no ſooner doth the Lords day Sabbath come, but forthwith Puritanes, vncloth themſelues of their baſe aray, and attire themſelues in their beſt apparell; and they lay aſide all ſeruile laboures for that time, as a profanation of that ſacred time; and much reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſe honour and deuotion, is performed in reſpect of this daies preſence: yea greate conſcience is made of it. (Pardon me beloued, the ſinnes of Gods children muſt not be clocked; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt I be partiall, no neither muſt I deale ouerly, but tell euery man, or ranke of men of their ſinne, without baulking) I cale it Puritane Idolatry, becauſe theſe are the greate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones thereof.</p>
                        <p>That I may diſcouer it vnto you, firſt we will begine with the word Idolatry; this word is a greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> &amp; it is compounded of two wordes: the one whereof ſignifieth, an <hi>image and likeneſse of a thing;</hi> or, an <hi>imagination and fiction of the braine:</hi> the other ſignifieth, <hi>honour and reuerence;</hi> now put both theſe together, and they ſignify, an <hi>honour and reuerence, of an image and likneſſe of a thing; or of an imagination and fiction of the braine:</hi> thus you haue the ſignification of the word Idolatry. Now when diuine and religiouſe honour is giuen to a ſimilitude or fiction of the mind, then it is a dangerouſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and when the conſcience ſtands in awe, of a ſimilitude or fiction of the braine, reuerencing it for a diuine ordinance, then it is Idolary. Now to apply this.</p>
                        <pb n="626" facs="tcp:21140:331"/>
                        <p> The Lords day is this Idoll; and they that preach for it, and practiſe it, are the Idolaters: to make this good, you ſhall ſee how fitly theſe may be caled Idolaters, and their practiſe Idolatry: firſt touching that parte of Idolatry which conſiſteth in <hi>imagery</hi> &amp; <hi>lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse,</hi> you ſhall ſee how like they haue framed the Lords day, to the Sabbath day, &amp; made it a very image, ſimilitude, &amp; likneſſe of the Sabbath day, &amp; conſequently an <hi>Idoll,</hi> for, 1. They haue giuen the very name, the proper name of the Lords Sabbath vnto it, for doe they not vſually cale the Sunday or Lords day, the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day? 2. They ſanctify and keepe the Lords day, like vnto the Sabbath day, with a reſting from all ſeruile laboures, &amp; with preaching, and prayers, and the like. 3. they keepe it in conſcience of the 4th com. like as the Sabbath day was. 4. They apply all thoſe textes of Scripture vnto the Lords day, which were wont to be applied to the Sabbath day, and which indeed are proper to the Sabbath day, as Neh. 13.15. Iſa. 58.13. Math. 12.1.2.3, &amp;c. with others, behold then, if they haue not made the Lords day, as like, as like may be, to the Sabbath day; an image or picture, cannot be more like a man, then they haue framed this Lords day, vnto the Sabbath day; nay the images &amp; ſimilitudes, which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts make of God, of Chriſt, or of Saintes, are not ſo like vnto God, &amp; Chriſt, &amp; Saints, as this Lords day, is made &amp; faſhoned, like the Lords Sabbath day: like as idolatrouſe <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made a feaſt vnto his calues, like vnto the feaſt that was in Iudah, 1. King 12.32. ſo haue theſe made a new Sabbath, like vnto the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in the Morall Law.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Touching that other acception of the word, where it is taken for an <hi>imagination, or fiction of the minde or braine:</hi> And in this ſenſe an Idoll is <hi>Nothing</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1. Cor. 8.4. <hi>An Jdoll is nothing in the world:</hi> that is, it is no ſuch thing, as it is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, &amp; fanſied to be, &amp; in this ſenſe alſo the Lords day is an Idoll, &amp; the obſeruers of it are Idolaters, &amp; their ſanctification of it Idolatry: for 1. whereas they cale the Lords day, Sabbath day, it is a mere fiction; for they neuer found it ſo named, in the Holy Scriptures, 2. That the Lords day, ſhould be kept like the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, with a reſt from laboures all day long, is an imaginary conceipt; for they find no ſuch obſeruation of it by Chriſt, nor
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:21140:331"/>by his Apoſtles. 3. That the Lords day ſhould be obſerued by virtue of the 4th com. is not onely a fiction, but an abſurd foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. 4. That Chriſt inſtituted the Lords day, is a mere forgery and fanſy of mens braine, as hath bene formerly ſhowne: and thus you ſee, that the Lords day; is a mere Idoll, or a very <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> that is, nothing but a fanſie &amp; fiction of mens braine: of this <hi>day</hi> therefore, we may ſay, as the Lord ſaid of <hi>Ieroboames</hi> (Moneth) which he had conſecrated vnto his Idoles, that it was <hi>the moneth which hee had forged of his owne heart,</hi> 1 King. 12, 33. ſo this Lords day, is the Sabbath day, which men haue forged of their owne hearts. And thus we haue cleered and made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, the two firſt things in this Idolatry, to wit, that the Lords day, is an Image and likneſſe: and that the Lords day, is an imagination and fiction; or an Idoll and Nothing.</p>
                        <p>I come now to the third thing, which maketh compleate I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry; and that is, Honour and Reuerence: for that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Idolatry, when religiouſe honour and reuerence, is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto Images and ſimilitudes; or vnto Imaginations and fictions of the braine; or vnto Idoles and Nothing as when men reuerence theſe as Diuine things, and as ordinances of God. Now I ſhall eaſily demonſtrate vnto you, that men giue Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour &amp; Reuerence vnto this Lords day, yea no ciuill honour, but diuine &amp; religiouſe Honour.</p>
                        <p>For, 1. The patrones of the Lords day, they doe eſteeme one day aboue an other, the Lords day aboue and before any other day in the weeke, and that in a religiouſe manner; &amp; thus they honour it, by aduancing it aboue all other daies: yea by holding the cauſe of the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lords day, to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then the cauſe of the inſtitution of the Sabbath day, they muſt hold, that the Lords day is an higher &amp; more honourable day, then was the Sabbath day: for they ſay, that the worke of the Redemption, was the cauſe of the inſtitution of the Lords day; now the worke of Redemption they hold to be a greater worke then was the worke of the Creation, which was the cauſe of the inſtitution of the Sabbath day; and thus you ſee they muſt haue the Lords day in more honour, then the Sabbath day was in.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They make a conſcience of obſeruing &amp; of ſanctifying
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:21140:332"/>the Lords day; &amp; doe reproue ſuch as profane it, &amp; make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon day of it by working; and hereby they doe Reuerence it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They obſerue the Lords day, as inſtituted by Chriſt, and as commanded by God, in his 4th com. and in ſo doeing, they doe Honour it and Reuerence it; for they honour it as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded day, and as a day ſet aparte by Chriſt to be Holy.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Many Diuines doe in their publike prayers, and ſermones, bleſſe God for vowchſafing vs his holy ordinances, as his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths and Sacraments &amp;c. by Sabbath, they meane our Lords daies; whereby you ſee, they honour the Lords day, together with the Sacraments; and ſo they muſt doe: for the Sacraments and the Lords day, haue both one vſe in the Church: for as the Sacraments doe minde vs of Chriſts death and reſurrection; ſo the Lords day is ſanctified in memory of Chriſts death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: thus the Lords day is honoured as the Sacraments are: now all men confeſſe that the Sacraments are honoured with diuine &amp; religiouſe honour, and ſo then is the Lords day alſo: yea, who feareth not to profane the Lords day, as he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to eate the Lords Supper vnworthily?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. They honour the Lords day with that kind of honour wherewith they honour the ſacred <hi>Name</hi> of God, inioyned in the third com. for they are carefull to ſanctifie the Lords day, as they are carefull to ſanctifie the Name of God: and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are in awe of the Lords day, as well as of the Name of God; for they feare to profane the Lords day, as well as they feare to blaſpheme &amp; abuſe the Holy Name of God: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect this day as an Holy day, like as Gods Name is an Holy Name.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. By ſetting the Lords day into the place and roome of the Sabbath day, they muſt and doe giue vnto it the like religiouſe honour which was due vnto the Sabbath day, &amp; that was a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſe honour: <hi>Call the Sabbath a delight, the Holy of the Lord, honourable,</hi> Iſai. 58.13. Now this very text is applied to our Lords day; wherefore it is honoured with diuine and religiouſe honour: and thus is their Idolatry compleate.</p>
                        <p>Note, that if this Honour and religiouſe reuerence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, be giuen but vnto any one of the two former ſenſes, it
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:21140:332"/>maketh Idolatry: for example, if the Lords day be conſidered of as an Image or likneſſe, to the Sabbath day; &amp; therevnto men add honour, this is Idolatry: or, if the Lords day, be but conſidered of, as an imagination, a fiction, or a deuiſe of mans braine, which indeed is an Idoll and Nothing, and then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> add a religiouſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcionable honour, reuerence, &amp; reſpect, be it <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> forthwith the Lords day becomes an Idoll, they Idolaters; &amp; their deuotion honour &amp; conſcience of it, Idolatry: for it is to ſet vp an Idoll in Gods worſhip, when men ſet vp their fictions, conceipts, &amp; deuiſes, to be reuerenced &amp; religiouſly honoured; when they place their owne deuices, &amp; ſet them in the firſt Table of the Decalogue; as now a daies men doe this Lords day.</p>
                        <p>In a word, it is the common and receiued opinion, that all Humane inventions, thruſt into diuine Seruice, or worſhip of God, are plaine Idolatry: now the Lords day, is an Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, as hath bene ſhowne; and it is thruſt into Diuine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and worſhip of God: for it is beleeued and taught to be an ordinance of Gods, commanded in the firſt Table, among the parts of Gods worſhip; and it is honoured, with that religiouſe reuerence, which is proper vnto God and the partes of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and therefore the Lords day, is an Idoll, &amp; the religiouſe ſanctification of it Idolatry.</p>
                        <p>The Lord would not indure it, that his meate &amp;c. ſhould be giuen vnto, and beſtowed vpon Idoles, <hi>My meate which I gaue thee, as fine flower, oyle, and hony, wherewith J fedd thee, thou haſt euen ſet it before them for a ſweete ſauour &amp;c.</hi> Ezek. 16.19. And can we thinke, that that God, who would not haue his meate, oyle, and hony, beſtowed vpon Idoles; will indure it, that we ſhall beſtow his glory, honour, loue, conſcience, &amp; religiouſe reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, vpon this Idoll of the Lords day Sabbath? for all thoſe Holy and religiouſe affectiones, which we beſtow vpon the Lords day Sabbath, they are Gods affectiones, &amp; proper vnto his Maieſtie: Now my glory ſaith God, I will not giue to an other, Iſa. 42.8. &amp; God is <hi>a Ielouſe God,</hi> as we read in the ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ex. 20.5. and therefore, he will neuer indure it, that this his glory and ſeruice, ſhall be beſtowed vpon an Idoll of mans making &amp;
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:21140:333"/>deuiſing: the Lord vpbraided the Iewes, becauſe they did Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrouſly <hi>worſhip the worke of their owne hands, which their owne fingers had made,</hi> Iſa. 2.8. ſo ridiculouſe they were: for who would worſhip a thing, which himſelfe hath made with his owne hands? but with vs, the conſcience is made to ſtand in awc of the worke of mens braines; and religiouſe honour &amp; Holy affectiones, and worſhip, are beſtowed vpon that which we haue made our ſelues, if not by our owne fingers, yet by our owne wittes: Now who would be ſo ridiculouſe, as to feare the pollution, of what himſelfe hath made Holy? or religiouſly to honour a meere nothing, a very fanſy?</p>
                        <p>For men to giue vnto the Lords day diuine honour, that is, to reuerence it as an ordinance of Gods, vpon paine of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, this is to aduance a fiction of mans braine, and place it in equall Throne with Gods ordinances, &amp; to exact of mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, like religiouſe reuerence, as is due vnto Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: for this fiction ſhall haue power to command and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreine the Conſcience, like as Gods ordinances haue, and that vpon paine of damnation too; what an heinouſe thing is this? Is it not as greate a ſinne, to giue Diuine worſhip, vnto mens fantaſies, as vnto Images! to the deuices of proteſtants, as to the Trinkets of Papiſtes? <hi>My glory</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I will not giue to an other,</hi> Iſa. 42.8. What an heinouſe and horrible ſinne then is it, for any to giue religiouſe worſhip, which is proper vnto God &amp; to his ordinances, to a meere deuice of mans making! God is a Ielouſe God, &amp; moſt zealouſe of his glory, woe therefore vnto him that robbeth God of his glory, to giue it vnto mens deuices.</p>
                        <p>Three euiles there are combined in this one, which make it a Capitall euill. 1. That the people of the Land who are moſt tractable vnto goodneſſe, haue their conſciences brought into ſlauery, bondage, &amp; thraldome, for they are made afraid of the ſhaddow of a man, of the ſhaking of the leaues of the trees, that is, that vpon paine of damnation, they worke not on the Lords day. 2. By the ſuppoſed neceſſary conſequences, men haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced this Idoll of the Lords day, and ranked it among the Starres of the Heauen, that is, they haue placed it among the
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:21140:333"/>Ordinances of God, &amp; giuen it like power ouer the conſcience which they haue; now how God will take this at their hands, it behoueth the Authors hereof to be thinke themſelues. 3. The Authors hereof doe bewray moſt audaciouſe preſumption, in that they dare approch ſo neere the Majeſtie of God, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe God, with their owne inventions; that they dare ranke them with the Ordinances of God: now what would they more, vnleſſe they take the Crowne? that is, to Deify themſelues? for who but A God, can exerciſe power ouer the conſcience, and make ordinances tying conſcience? and of equall authority, &amp; power with Diuine ordinances? Since this deformity is in the viſage of a Proteſtant, happilly it will be winked at, or ouerly looked vpon, or minced and extenuated, if not defended, but were it, in the face of a Papiſt, ſuer I am it ſhould find no mercy, but according to the iuſt deſert thereof, it ſhould be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauated to the full: but what ſhould I ſay? loue is blind, I meane ſelf loue: we can ſpie a blemiſh in an other, but cannot or will not ſee it in our ſelues.</p>
                        <p>I cannot ſee but that theſe men may as well ſet vp a new Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> in ſtead of the old one, as to ſet vp a new Sabbath in roome of the old one: or an other <hi>Lords Supper</hi> in ſtead of that inſtituted by Chriſt, as an other Sabbath in roome of that inſtituted by God: and ſince none but a God can ſet vp Sacraments and Sabbaths in the Church, what elſe doe they but vſurpe the roome and Authority of God, who ſet vp new Sabbaths in the Church? By the way, as touching Gods ancient Sabbaths; haue not Papiſts by their reaſons and conſequences out of Scripture (which theſe men call their neceeſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; but how vnneceſſary you haue ſeene) aboliſhed Gods Sabbaths, expreſly commanded in the Morall Law? and haue they not hereby aduanced their Syllogiſticall reaſon, to be of equall authority with neuer erring Scriptures? and their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to be of equall authority with Gods 4th commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? nay to take the vpper hand, and to ſhowlder out of place Gods commandement? Now ſince a law inacted in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot be reuoked but by the ſame authority that firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted it, doth it not follow that Papiſts make Idoles of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:21140:334"/>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their reaſon ſhall be a Countermand to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement? were Papiſts onely guilty of this ſinne, a man might with applauſe manage this argument againſt them: but ſince Proteſtants alſo haue a hand therein, I dare not paſſe my cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee, the Lords day is an Idoll, the preachers for it Idolaters, and their obſeruation of it Idolatry, (let none enuy &amp; malice mee, for diſcouering vnto them this their ſinne; but rather, let them turne their enuy againſt themſelues, for being ſuch ſinners, and their malice againſt their ſinne; nor let any ſtudy to wreſt my words; but let their ſtudy be how to worke a reformation). To conclude this point, ſeeing that as the caſe ſtandeth, there is Idolatry committed by many thowſands in the Land, and that by moſt puritanes, is it not high time to ſeeke out for a reformation?</p>
                        <p>Now lay all theſe forementioned things togeather, and be ſtirred vp to endeauor for a reformation: for ſo, as S. Iames ſpeaketh, <hi>Thou ſhalt hide a multitude of ſinnes</hi> Iam. 5.20. And endeauour for a <hi>ſpeedy</hi> reformation: for reformation is <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi> &amp; Repentance is by no meanes, to be delayed and procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated, as we are daily taught.</p>
                        <p>I reade in the prophecy of the Prophet Haggay, an excellent exhortation, to incourag all ſortes of people, to the reedifying of the Temple; it is this, <hi>Yet now be ſtronge, o Zerubbabel, ſaith the Lord, and be ſtrong, o Ioſhuah, ſone of Jehozadak the High Prieſt: and be ſtrong all yee people of the Land, ſaith the Lord, and worke: for J am with you, ſaith the Lord of Hoaſtes.</hi> Hagg. 2.4. I verily thinke that I may apply this Exhortation, vnto all ſortes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple now; to incourag them to the reedifying of the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, ſaying, be ſtrong, o Prince, be ſtrong, o Prieſt, &amp; be ſtrong, all yee people of the Land, and worke; for the Lord of Hoaſtes is with you: God was with his Church in the daies of Luther, he proſpered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo as gloriouſly they reformed the corruptions in his worſhip, and the Idolatry daily committed againſt the ſecond commandement; why ſhould we doubt but that the
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:21140:334"/>ſame God fauourably alloweth this our worke? or feare to expect a like bleſſing, when the Caſes are ſo like?</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Remember the Sabbath day, to keepe it Holy: That 7th day, is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt not doe any worke: For the Lord rested on the 7th day, and therefore the Lord bleſſed the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and Hallowed it, Exod.</hi> 20.8.10.11.</q>
